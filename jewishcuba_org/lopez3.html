                    Bettinger-Lopez decided to take a close look at Miami's Cuban 
                    Jewish community as part of her college senior thesis. The 
                    project evolved into a book that will be released in October 
                    and set her on a career path to become an immigration lawyer. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Bettinger-Lopez, a Pinecrest 
                    native and 1994 graduate of Palmetto Senior High School, said 
                    the idea for her book -- Cuban Jewish Journeys: Searching 
                    for Identity, Home and History in Miami ­ materialized near 
                    the end of her junior year at the University of Michigan. 
                    </font>
                  <p> <font face="Arial" size="-1">"I was an anthropology major 
                    and in my junior year I became interested in looking at issues 
                    of identity, community and culture," she said. "I decided 
                    that an interesting place to look at this would be the Cuban 
                    community of Miami. </font>
                  <p> <font face="Arial" size="-1">"The Cuban Jewish community 
                    for me had personal significance," she continued. "I grew 
                    up Jewish and I found it fascinating that there was this community 
                    that I had never heard of. Growing up in South Miami, the 
                    Pinecrest area, I never knew that there were Cuban Jews and 
                    that there were two Cuban synagogues on Miami Beach, really 
                    three." </font>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Bettinger-Lopez began canvassing 
                    Little Havana and Miami Beach, interviewing people, sampling 
                    opinion, and gathering information. She says she talked with 
                    hundreds of people representing a broad, diverse cross-section 
                    of the community. <img src="cblpine.jpg" width="144" height="175" align="right"></font>
                  <p> <font face="Arial" size="-1">"What this project became for 
                    me was an ethnographic portrait of a community which is at 
                    most about 40 years old," she explained, "a community that 
                    I never knew about, but one that was right in my back yard. 
                    I wanted to reflect the different perspectives of different 
                    members within the community. </font>
                  <p> <font face="Arial" size="-1">"I wanted to show perspectives 
                    on women's roles and how traditional Jewish culture or Cuban 
                    culture might influence something such as women's roles or 
                    the role of the child; how these influences come into somebody's 
                    life and how they might influence you, especially depending 
                    on age and when you came to this country, if you were born 
                    here or what generation American you are. These issues became 
                    the overriding framework of this book." </font>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> As a college thesis, Bettinger-Lopez' 
                    work won two honors awards and her professors encouraged her 
                    to publish it as a book. She says several publishers expressed 
                    an interest, but she decided on University of Tennessee Press, 
                    which will release the 300-plus-page book in October. </font>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> As a result of her work on 
                    the book, Bettinger-Lopez became intensely interested in immigration 
                    issues. Upon finishing college, she worked for a year with 
                    AmeriCorps as a student victim advocate at Miami Beach Senior 
                    High, then worked with the Miami-Dade guardian ad litum program 
                    for abused children and last year taught school in Haiti. 
                    </font>
                  <p> <font face="Arial" size="-1">"I taught kids who came from 
                    the poorest areas of Haiti, but who were academically gifted," 
                    she said. "From that I developed an attitude that we really 
                    need to reach out and I felt the necessity to be a part of 
                    human rights, the community and really try to be helping." 
                    </font>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Bettinger-Lopez and her husband 
                    Sean will move to New York this month where she will enroll 
                    in Columbia Law School. </font>
                  <p> <font face="Arial" size="-1">"Really, because of this book 
                    I became interested in human rights and immigration issues, 
                    the rights of immigrants when they reach American soil," she 
                    said. "So, I'm going to law school." </font>
