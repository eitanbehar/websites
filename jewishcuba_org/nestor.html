          Steiner</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
          are building a system of Jewish religious education in Cuba which will 
          last far beyond their two years of service to Cuba's Jewish communities. 
          Assigned to Cuba by the Buenos Aires office of the New York-based Joint 
          Distribution Committee, Nestor and Mara are methodically helping to 
          build a series of educational programs which, after they depart in August 
          of 2004, will be operated by the Cubans.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">These programs 
          include:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Bar and Bat 
          Mitzvah training</b>, an eight-month program to train young people coming 
          of age in all of Cuba's thirteen Jewish communities. Starting with three 
          young men and three young women, they are focused now on the central 
          part of the country. Young people attend a study session every two weeks, 
          and also have home assignments. In the past there was no program, and 
          Bar Mitzvah training took place on as as-needed basis. In early 2004 
          there were Bar and Bat Mitzvah candidates in Havana, Cienfuegos, Sancti 
          Spiritus, and Santiago de Cuba.<img src="art04.jpg" width="375" height="223" align="right" vspace="6" hspace="6"></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A <b>Course in 
          Judaism and Jewish Studies</b> has begun for the communities, with follow-up 
          materials provided. The course covers important elements of the Jewish 
          faith and culture, with study of such topics as history, holidays, the 
          life cycle and related events and celebrations, and Jewish folk tales. 
          This course is being developed with three different teams, and is now 
          in Santiago de Cuba and Havana. Eventually each community will have 
          this program.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">An extensive <b>Sunday 
          School </b>program for the Patronato, Havana's Jewish Community Center, 
          which will eventually be available throughout Cuba. At the present time 
          this program serves young people from four years old to sixteen, with 
          fourteen teachers, allowing two teachers per class for a total of 65 
          children. There is also an adult program with 30 adults participating. 
          Nestor and Mara worked with the community to develop the pedological 
          content for these programs.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A <b>Teacher Training 
          System</b>, a program which will eventually be able to provide trained 
          teachers in most of Cuba's Jewish communities.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A <b>Summer Camp</b>, 
          for youth, adults, and seniors. These camps are held away from the cities 
          and in a natural environment, including mountain towns with facilities 
          for visiting groups. These camps give individuals from across the country 
          a chance to get to know members from other Jewish communities. Activities 
          include both recreation and study, and last for three days. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">They helped restart 
          <b>Menorah</b>, a newsletter used as a means of Jewish education and 
          communication throughout Cuba.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Nestor and Mara 
          are energetic in describing the support given by the Joint Distribution 
          Committee (JDC). &quot;We appreciate and welcome the support given to 
          us,&quot; they say. &quot;Without this support we could not do the work 
          we have been sent here to do.&quot; They are the fifth couple sent to 
          Cuba by the JDC, and have formalized much of the work which has taken 
          place before. Nestor's training as a computer analyst is obvious in 
          the systematic development of programs, with a solid support base being 
          established for their continuation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When asked about 
          the possibility of a Cuban rabbi in the future, Mara replies, &quot;That 
          would be complicated. Someone would have to come out of the community 
          here, make the decision to be a rabbi, then would have to go away to 
          Buenos Aires or New York or elsewhere for training. It would be a long 
          process. At this time we don't think this will happen anytime soon.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When Nestor and 
          Mara leave Cuba in August, they will leave behind a much better organized 
          Jewish community, and a system of religious education which will help 
          strengthen the continuing revitalization of Cuba's Jewish congregations.</font></p>
