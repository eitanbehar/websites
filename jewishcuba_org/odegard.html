          January 15, 2005 </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> A pleasant Caribbean 
          breeze filled the large room, a Jewish sanctuary in Havana, where a 
          Minneapolis rabbi stood and told the congregation and 22 Twin Cities 
          visitors of her family's remarkable journey to freedom. In an astonishing 
          convergence of Torah subject and true-life storytelling, Temple Israel 
          Rabbi Marcia Zimmerman held a firm grip on her audience with the tale 
          of her Russian grandfather's long and slightly detoured voyage to America. 
          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Max Pasternak 
          left Russia by ship in early 1920, at a time when the U.S. port-of-entry 
          at Ellis Island in New York was temporarily closed for expansion and 
          repairs. His ship was rerouted to Cuba. He stayed there for a few months 
          and eventually joined his uncle's family in St. Louis, where his future 
          bride was waiting. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Not long after 
          Pasternak left Cuba, the U.S. borders were closed, and most of the Ashkenazic 
          (Eastern European) Jews, along with a number of Sephardic (Mediterranean) 
          Turkish Jews, about 17,000 people total, found themselves unexpectedly 
          stranded in Cuba. Through four decades, most would remain there. </font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"If my grandfather 
          was delayed, I would be a Cuban Jew," said Zimmerman, reflecting on 
          her visit slightly more than a year ago to the Communist island nation 
          on a humanitarian mission with members from her Reform congregation. 
          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> At Beth Shalom 
          congregation in Havana, Zimmerman was invited to deliver the sermon 
          at Shabbat morning services. Her message was based on the Torah reading, 
          Genesis 33, the "Sedra Va Yezah," in which brothers Jacob and Esau are 
          squabbling. She also spoke about Jacob's Ladder, the Tower of Babel 
          and Mount Sinai, tying each of these biblical themes together to underscore 
          the need to "strengthen the Cuban Jewish community and its ties with 
          the American Jewish community as well." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Zimmerman believes 
          the journey to Havana "allowed Temple Israel in Minneapolis, Minnesota, 
          to extend our hands to help the Jewish community of Cuba, which fulfilled 
          not only our own belief that one of Judaism's central teachings is about 
          ethical works in the world, but also fulfilled the mission given to 
          our movement in 2003" by a leading American rabbi. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Rabbi Eric Yoffe, 
          President of the Union of Reform Judaism emphasized in a speech that 
          "we must see the Jewish community as an international community. It 
          is not enough for American Jews to be concerned with Israel alone, but 
          that we must reach out to other Jews wherever they are in need." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> With that message 
          in mind, Temple Israel saw the humanitarian mission to Cuba as "a way 
          to reach out to the international Jewish community and strengthen ties 
          between all Jews as the world continues to change," Zimmerman said. 
          </font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"The second reason 
          centers on the mission as a congregation," she added. "Because we are 
          an urban congregation, we are aware of our responsibility to ensure 
          that the community in Minneapolis receives the support it needs to remain 
          vibrant and a place where everyone's lives get better. This mission 
          centers on social justice and social action work. When this trip was 
          first spoken about, the fact that it was a humanitarian mission was 
          quite appealing." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The Temple Israel 
          group brought into Cuba more than 1,000 pounds of medical aid worth 
          several thousand dollars. "Access to medication is problematic in Cuba," 
          Zimmerman said. "Basic medications like ibuprofen, Tylenol, antibiotics 
          and others are not always available and not easily accessible. This 
          means there is little hope without outside help." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> And while the 
          Communist state says it provides the necessities for its people -- and 
          therefore, higher wages are unnecessary -- reality suggests otherwise. 
          School supplies, for example, are priced far beyond what an average 
          Cuban can afford. This inspired the Temple Israel visitors to bring 
          in school supplies -- crayons, paper, books, notebooks and the like. 
          Many Cuban converts</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Nearly 90% of 
          the Cuban Jewish population departed following the 1959 revolution that 
          brought Fidel Castro to power. Over the next four-plus decades, the 
          remaining Jewish population has intermarried with the members of indigenous 
          faiths. And Jews count many converts among their current ranks of 1,200. 
          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Most Cubans know 
          little, if anything, about Judaism. There is no rabbi or cantor in the 
          Havana area. The music, teachings and worship are taught by local Jews 
          trained by two young adult educators sent to Cuba from Argentina. With 
          the breakdown of the Soviet system in the late 1980s, religion became 
          more acceptable. Each year since then, Americans, Canadians and others 
          have visited to help their fellow Jews. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Havana's largest 
          and most active synagogue is part of a recently remodeled complex most 
          often referred to as the "Patronato," a combination of Beth Shalom Synagogue, 
          a library, clinic, community center and Sunday School. </font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"It is a fairly 
          large sanctuary with no loud fans and would be quite acceptable in the 
          United States," recalled mission participant Paul Slaton. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> June Safran, executive 
          director of the Cuba-America Jewish Mission in Berkeley, Calif., has 
          been visiting Havana for 10 years and bringing aid groups for the past 
          eight. She loves the Jewish communities of Havana and the provinces. 
          She praises the public school system, "which offers equal opportunity 
          for all children and quality teaching, even though some materials are 
          hard to come by. The children wear uniforms, the teachers are very good 
          and standards are generally high." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Asked about the 
          neighborhood around the Patronato, Safran said, "Like all large cities, 
          there is a certain lack of socialization between neighbors that does 
          not exist in the smaller cities in the provinces. The closest members 
          live 2 blocks away. Most people live farther. Some walk as far as 3 
          miles. Some drive greater distances. </font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"They come in 
          all ages and both sexes. Many people between 20 and 40 attend, both 
          married and single. I find the synagogue comfortable, and I feel like 
          a member. There are youngsters running up and down the aisles these 
          days. It's a pleasure to see how at home they feel." </font>
