                  <br>
                  CAMAGUEY, Cuba -- Thirty-six years ago, Alberto Roffe's grandfather 
                  dug a hole in this city's only Jewish cemetery, lowered his 
                  community's prayer books into it and covered the crypt with 
                  concrete.<br>
                  <br>
                  Cuba's communist government had closed down Camaguey's two synagogues 
                  and nationalized most of the small businesses run by Jews, prompting 
                  most of the 800 Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews living in this 
                  sleepy interior city to flee the country.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now the religious resurgence that has seen Jews in Havana reclaim 
                  their temples and reorganize their communities in recent years 
                  is reaching Camaguey. The city's 27 Jewish families -- the third-largest 
                  Jewish community in Cuba -- are planning to open the island's 
                  first new synagogue since Fidel Castro's rebels took power in 
                  1959.<br>
                  <br>
                  ``The only time we were able to come together since (Castro) 
                  came to power was to say the Kaddish when someone died,'' says 
                  Roffe, 47, a mechanic who serves as president of the local Jewish 
                  community.<br>
                  <br>
                  The opening of the new synagogue -- a humble white turn-of-the-century 
                  house connected to a row of homes in the city's center -- is 
                  set for Rosh Hashana in late September, the final step after 
                  years spent obtaining permission to buy the house and months 
                  spent renovating it.<br>
                  <br>
                  Roffe, whose grandfather came to Cuba to avoid religious persecution 
                  in Turkey after World War I, says he has dreamed of opening 
                  a synagogue in Camaguey since the government prohibited his 
                  family and others from celebrating the Sabbath soon after Castro 
                  declared the island a Marxist state. As more and more Jews fled 
                  to the United States, the community disbanded and traditions 
                  grew harder to maintain.<br>
                  <br>
                  The government's hard-line stance began to ease in the 1980s. 
                  Then, with the 1991 collapse of Cuba's benefactor, the Soviet 
                  Union, Castro took the practical steps of liberalizing the economy 
                  and permitting greater personal freedoms, including the practice 
                  of organized religion.<br>
                  <br>
                  In 1992, the government even decreed that one could be a good 
                  communist and still be devoutly religious.<br>
                  <br>
                  Shortly after, representatives from the American Jewish Joint 
                  Distribution Committee, a nonprofit, New York-based organization 
                  that provides cultural and humanitarian aid to Jewish communities, 
                  received permission to enter Cuba.<br>
                  <br>
                  ``They taught us how to sing the prayers; they brought books 
                  and gefilte fish -- and, most importantly, they taught what 
                  we couldn't to our children,'' says Sara Albojaira, 41, a social 
                  worker and former president of Camaguey's Jewish community. 
                  ``Years without formally practicing and without any organized 
                  services really removed us from Judaism. Most of us, like me, 
                  had to marry out of the religion. There were no Jews.''<br>
                  <br>
                  Things were far different 40 years ago. Cuba's Jewish communities 
                  flourished following a wave of immigration of Jews fleeing persecution 
                  in Europe before and during World War II. Before the revolution, 
                  more than a dozen synagogues served as many as 20,000 Cuban 
                  Jews. In Camaguey, two temples, Shevet Ajim for Ashkenazis and 
                  Tiferet Israel for Sephardics, were built in the 1920s as the 
                  community grew to more than 800 Jews, Roffe says.<br>
                  <br>
                  But after Castro's government made its anti-religion policies 
                  clear, those Jews who did not flee the island were forced to 
                  either observe their traditions at home or allow themselves 
                  to be assimilated into the prevailing atheistic culture.<br>
                  <br>
                  Roffe and the other Jewish leaders in Camaguey began investigating 
                  the possibility of opening a synagogue soon after the Joint 
                  Distribution Committee and other international Jewish organizations 
                  helped unite the city's Jewish population. The Camaguey enclave 
                  received another boost in 1995, when an Argentine rabbi converted 
                  21 people, mostly spouses and children who have Jewish relatives.<br>
                  <br>
                  ``This community reinvented itself in a few years,'' says Merle 
                  Salkin, director of the Society Hill Synagogue in Philadelphia, 
                  who made her fourth trip here in June to teach Hebrew classes. 
                  ``It was never organized. Families never knew what other families 
                  were doing. People started coming out of the woodwork, asking 
                  questions and signing up for conversion classes.''<br>
                  <br>
                  In 1996, after ignoring repeated inquiries, the government granted 
                  Roffe and other Jewish leaders permission to open the new synagogue. 
                  After a suitable house was found, officials delayed authorizing 
                  the land sale for two years. Approval for the sale finally came 
                  in March, though other bureaucratic obstacles held up the land 
                  transfer until June.<br>
                  <br>
                  The synagogue will be the country's fifth. Three synagogues 
                  survived the revolution -- all in Havana, where about 90 percent 
                  of the island's estimated 1,500 Jews live. In 1995, the government 
                  allowed a congregation of about 90 Jews to reclaim its former 
                  synagogue in Santiago de Cuba, the island's second-largest city.<br>
                  <br>
                  ``This is not something that happens overnight here,'' Roffe 
                  says. ``Little by little, with patience, we will have our synagogue.''<br>
                  <br>
                  It is happening with the help of outsiders. The $6,000 to pay 
                  for the house came from Ruben Beraja, an Argentine with the 
                  International Congress of Latin American Jews. Salkin's Philadelphia 
                  congregation donated $3,000 for renovations and dozens of tallits, 
                  yarmulkes and prayer books.<br>
                  <br>
                  Despite the shabby condition of the white house, Jewish leaders 
                  say it has become a symbol of the community's resurgence.<br>
                  <br>
                  ``The new Tiferet Israel is our reconnection with the past,'' 
                  says Johandy Crespo, 20, the community's youth group leader, 
                  lifting a stone tablet covering the site where the prayer books 
                  remained buried. ``This is our future.''<br>
