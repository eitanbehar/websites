              <div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">In Cuba, people refer 
                to the five years since the collapse of the Soviet Union as <i>El 
                Perdido Espicial</i> - "The Special Period." </font> </div>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> In fact, the past 
                half-decade has been anything but "special" for people on the 
                Communist Caribbean island nation. Deprived of its Soviet benefactor 
                and still saddled with a U.S. economic blockade, Cuba suffers 
                from a devastated economy, a crumbling infrastructure and chronic 
                shortages of just about everything. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> But for the island's 
                1,300 Jews, the past five years have been something special indeed. 
                After some 35 years of having their religion actively discouraged 
                by the Communist governement, Judaism is experiencing a startling 
                renaissance. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> East Bay filmmaker 
                Bonnie Burt takes a rare look at Cuba's emerging Jewish community 
                in her new video <i>The Believers: Stories from Jewish Havana,</i>&#160;which 
                juxtaposes the economic hardships of Cuban life with the rebirth 
                of Jadaism there. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Burt met the Jews 
                of Cuba on a recent Jewish humanitarian mission to Havana, where 
                the majority of them live. "We saw teenagers who could <i>daven,</i>&#160;young 
                people who could lead services," she said. "It was an incredible 
                display of their yearning for Judaism. </font> 
              <p align="left"> <font face="Arial" size="-1">"As depressing as 
                it was to see the need that existed, that's how exciting it was 
                to see this return to Jewish life." </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> And the extent of 
                the need there is certainly depressing. According to Burt, Jews 
                - and nearly everyone else in Cuba - lack even the most basic 
                medical and food supplies. Meat is seldom available; because of 
                rationing, many people subsist on only one full meal a day, which 
                they supplement with glasses of sugar-water for energy. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Public services, such 
                as transportation, aren't much better. Burt's video tells the 
                story of one physician who gets to the bus stop each morning at 
                7. If the bus doesn't arrive by 11, she gives up and goes home 
                for the day. "Even if she got to work, there are no medicines 
                for her to prescribe," Burt said. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Because of gasoline 
                shortages, electricity blackouts are common, she added; most Cubans 
                get around on bicycle. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Given such difficult 
                circumstances, it would seem that religious worship would drop 
                off. In fact, for Havana's Jews, the opposite has happened. The 
                city's four synagogues - two Ashkenazi, two Sephardic - are full 
                each Shabbat, with young people eager to recover their Jewish 
                roots. </font> 
              <p align="left"> <font face="Arial" size="-1">"Here we take going 
                to synagogue for granted; there they make extraordinary efforts 
                to come every week," said Burt. "It was quite something to realize 
                how much it meant to them." </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> The new blossoming 
                of Cuban Jewry arises mainly from the confluence of two events 
                in 1991. In October of that year, the Cuban government relaxed 
                restrictions on religious believers joining the Communist Party. 
                Shortly thereafter, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee 
                began sending in needed supplies such as books and foods, as well 
                as sponsoring visits by a Mexican rabbi four times a year. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Jews have lived in 
                Cuba since the time of Columbus. In the early part of the century, 
                thousands fleeing Europe viewed Cuba as a temporary stop on their 
                way to the United States. Few expected to stay, but exit visas 
                were hard to come by, and as time passed, the Jews built lives 
                for themselves. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> During the revolution 
                of 1959, most of the country's 15,000 Jews fled to Miami, Mexico 
                or Israel. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> According to Burt, 
                many of those who remain would live to immigrate to Israel, but 
                the government seldom allows entire families to leave the country 
                at the same time. However, she added, "the Chief Rabbi of Israel 
                just visited Fidel (Castro) and they hope that some arrangements 
                can be made." </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Burt hopes to use 
                her video to raise consciousness - and money - for the Jews of 
                Cuba. "We hear very little in the United States about Cuba," she 
                said. "A lot of people don't know that there's a Jewish community 
                down there, much less that there's a need."</font>
