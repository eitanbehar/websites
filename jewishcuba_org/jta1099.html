              <p> ASHKELON, Israel, Oct. 19 (1999) - (JTA) -- As the dramatic 
                story of the immigration of 400 Cubans to Israel was broadcast 
                across the world last week, the new Israelis put the spotlight 
                to good use and publicly aired their grievances after many months 
                of silence. 
              <p> But even the three drab, seven-story buildings where they live 
                in the Jewish Agency for Israel absorption center in Ashkelon 
                could not keep the immigrants from bursting with excitement. And 
                when a government delegation led by Absorption Minister Yuli Tamir 
                paid a visit to this southern coastal town last week, Grisel Hernandez 
                insisted on making a statement. 
              <p> ``I am very satisfied in Israel," said the 30-year-old former 
                English teacher in impressive Hebrew. ``Every day when I wake 
                up in bed I say thank you." 
              <p> The combination of grumbling and joy accurately reflects the 
                complex situation these immigrants feel here today. 
              <p> Many are angry at how they have been treated in the months since 
                their arrival, yet most of the immigrants interviewed by JTA say 
                they are happy to be in the country, and none said they wanted 
                to leave. 
              <p> Although they embraced the media spotlight, they are still unsure 
                how the recent publicity surrounding the story will affect the 
                chances of their relatives, among some 1,300 Jews left in Cuba, 
                to emigrate. 
              <p> An official close to the situation, however, said the latest 
                group of about 15 people, down form original estimates of 20, 
                had already departed Cuba and was expected in Israel on Wednesday, 
                indicating that the publicity has had no negative effect on the 
                exodus. 
              <p> Typically, between 15 and 20 Cubans arrive in Israel each month, 
                the official said. 
              <p> Only last week did Israeli military censors open the subject 
                to the media. As details emerged, it became clear that the Jewish 
                Agency had assisted in the emigration of some 400 Jews since 1995. 
                The Jewish Agency had entered an agreement with Fidel Castro to 
                keep the operation quiet in return for an obstacle-free operation. 
              <p> Although the Cuban immigration was not widely known, one thing 
                is certain, says Hernandez: Castro ``knew about the entire thing," 
                she says, wondering why the mission was shrouded in secrecy. ``Nothing 
                happens in Cuba that Fidel does not know. And in Cuba, professionals, 
                doctors and teachers cannot leave without permission from Fidel 
                Castro or his buddies." 
              <p> Immigrants here say it is much more difficult for professionals 
                to secure an exit visa from the country, and Israeli officials 
                say the majority of the immigrants who have arrived are blue-collar 
                workers. 
              <p> In addition, among the Jewish immigrants are many non-Jews who 
                are eligible for Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return, 
                which grants even grandchildren of a Jew the right to aliyah. 
                In a tiny Jewish community like Cuba, say immigrants, intermarriage 
                is inevitable. 
              <p> ``I am not Jewish, but I feel like a Jew," says Alfredo Sotolongo, 
                41, wearing a red cap, gold earring and bracelets, a fat cigar 
                wedged between his fingers. ``During the last 8 years, we were 
                very active in the synagogue." 
              <p> Sotolongo came to Israel with Violeta Perez Nieto, his second 
                wife, and four stepchildren. His stepson Ewduin Perez, 24, is 
                also not technically Jewish. But when Jews began reviving community 
                life in the early 1990s after Castro became more tolerant of open 
                religious practice, the family started going to synagogue. 
              <p> Perez's grandfather was Jacobo Perez Meshulam, who immigrated 
                from Turkey to Cuba and was a founder of the local synagogue. 
              <p> ``We lived with him, and during my childhood I always remembered 
                seeing the Jews swaying at prayer," says Perez, recalling the 
                small group of Jews who remained devout even when the regime was 
                less tolerant. 
              <p> A few years ago, a group of youngsters began organizing activities. 
              <p> ``I began going to Friday night services, Shabbat morning services, 
                and every Sunday I participated in Hebrew classes," says Perez. 
              <p> Perez mentions the name of Jose Miller, a community leader who 
                apparently was close with Castro, as having been one factor in 
                Castro's decision to let the Jews go. But he, and most other immigrants 
                interviewed, say they found out they could leave via rumors that 
                spread through the community like wildfire. 
              <p> As the word spread, Perez, who was working in a cigar factory, 
                made his decision, and headed for the Canadian Embassy to submit 
                his paperwork. 
              <p> Canada, which maintains relations with Cuba, helped facilitate 
                the emigration since there are no diplomatic ties between Israel 
                and Cuba. 
              <p> Perez does not hide his motives, and does not profess any Zionist 
                ideology, yet he says he is willing to work hard, serve in the 
                army and start again in Israel if given the chance. 
              <p> ``I came because life was hard in Cuba," he says. ``We felt 
                like dogs in Cuba, but here I feel like the same dog with a different 
                collar." 
              <p> Eitan Behar, who was known in his hometown of Santiago de Cuba 
                as Jorge, is one of the immigrants whose desire to come to Israel 
                stemmed from a reawakening of his Jewish identity. 
              <p> Behar, a 27-year-old engineer, was the youth leader of Hatikva, 
                which he describes as ``a small, but very active" group in the 
                Jewish community in Santiago, which began to hold regular Sabbath 
                gatherings in 1993. 
              <p> The renewal of Jewish life was ``very powerful for us, very 
                intense," he says in a telephone interview from Beersheva where 
                he lives with his wife, Nili. 
              <p> ``We realized we didn't know how to do services, Kabalat Shabbat, 
                to sing the tunes." 
              <p> For help, his community turned to the Jewish community in Havana, 
                to the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee and to other 
                groups from the United States, Latin America and Canada. 
              <p> Learning about Judaism, he says, naturally led him and Nili 
                to learn about Israel, where they decided to make a new life. 
              <p> Behar said things are working out according to his plans, but 
                he admits, ``As immigrants we have several obstacles to overcome: 
                language, getting a job, learning a new country." 
              <p> For most of the immigrants, the biggest problem is that they 
                have been granted immigrant rights similar to those received by 
                immigrants from Western countries. 
              <p> But unlike their Western counterparts, Cuban immigrants were 
                not allowed to bring any money or property out of Cuba. Their 
                snappy dress in designer clothing is misleading; two suitcases 
                of clothing were all they were allowed to take out. The rest of 
                their property was nationalized. 
              <p> The immigrants argue they should therefore be eligible for the 
                same absorption package granted to immigrants from impoverished 
                countries like Ethiopia. Most importantly, they want to receive 
                the same amount of assistance for buying an apartment. 
              <p> Israel's Absorption Ministry says the average Cuban family will 
                receive up to $30,000 for a mortgage, while the average Ethiopian 
                family is granted as much as $75,000. 
              <p> The Jewish Agency has allowed the Cubans to stay at their absorption 
                centers longer than the usual six- month period, knowing that 
                their status must first be ironed out. 
              <p> ``I am still optimistic," says Perez, echoing the sentiments 
                of many immigrants at the absorption center, some who were upset 
                at the Israeli media for making it sound like many were on the 
                verge of leaving the country. 
              <p> ``Israel is our country and we love this country," says Alexe 
                Colon, 23, a fiery redheaded young man who left his law studies 
                in Havana to come to Israel. 
              <p> ``We do not want to go back to Cuba, but we do want to be given 
                mortgage rights similar to those of the Ethiopians." 
              <p> Isis Segal, 29, agrees. ``We have no work yet, and it is very 
                difficult, but it was very hard to keep quiet for so long," she 
                says. ``We only hope the publicity will not hurt the chances of 
                our relatives coming to Israel." 
              <p> Last week, as the publicity began to dissipate, Cuba appeared 
                to be dispelling rumors that Jews would be kept from leaving. 
                Alejandro Gonzalez, Cuba's foreign minster, said Cuba had never 
                blocked the exit of any Jews nor had they encouraged them to leave. 
              <p> Reports of a secret deal to allow Cuban Jews to leave were ``cheap 
                sensationalism," he said. ``We will not stop" them from emigrating, 
                ``nor have we obliged them to do so,'' he said.
