                  Zayón and Pável Tenenbaum</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
                  are President and Past-President, respectively, of the Jewish 
                  Cuban Youth Group which has taken the name of &quot;Maccabi 
                  Cuba.&quot; &quot;But we are more than a sports club,&quot; 
                  says </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">María 
                  Luisa, who is called &quot;Malu&quot; by her friends. &quot;We 
                  took the name to keep tradition, to associate with a well-known 
                  organization.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Malu and 
                  Pável serve as co-leaders of the group, appointed by a board 
                  of advisors. Both served as counselors before their appointments, 
                  which they considered to be good training for the responsibilities 
                  they have now. Malu, a journalism student at the University 
                  of Havana, and Pável, who has a degree in economics from the 
                  same university, speak enthusiastically about the group and 
                  its activities.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;The 
                  group has changed over the years,&quot; says Malu. &quot;Now 
                  they are more interested in religious services than they were 
                  in the past.&quot; With support from the Joint Distribution 
                  Committee (JDC) the group has lectures on Judaism provided for 
                  them, with a Saturday night course available which covers history, 
                  holidays, and other topics related to Jewish life.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;The 
                  group celebrates all the holidays,&quot; says Pável. &quot;And 
                  we also are involved in many projects which help the community.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Some of 
                  these projects include the Health Assistance Program, providing 
                  medical assistance to members of the congregation when needed. 
                  &quot;If the people can't come to the Patronato (Havana's Jewish 
                  Community Center) then we go out to them,&quot; says Pável. 
                  Assistance is offered through the provision of such items as 
                  medicine, disposable sheets, and clothing.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Other projects 
                  include the annual JDC camp, which brings in Jewish participants 
                  from all over Cuba to a rustic location for activities and study. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;There 
                  are around 150 young people involved,&quot; says Malu. &quot;And 
                  they help with all the activities of the community center and 
                  with the other congregations around the country.&quot; Each 
                  community has counselors, she says, who help with the programs 
                  in most of Cuba's thirteen Jewish communities. &quot;The counselor's 
                  group trains new leaders, and in turn they train others, so 
                  we are always training new people to take responsibility.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><img src="art21.jpg" width="218" height="187" align="left" vspace="6" hspace="8" alt="P&aacute;vel Tenenbaum">&quot;And 
                  the responsibility grows each year,&quot; adds Pável. &quot;For 
                  example, we help the community and other groups such as B'nai 
                  B'rith with things like home repair, and we help in activities 
                  around the synagogue.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">There is 
                  also a small committed group within the larger group named &quot;kesher&quot; 
                  (&quot;together&quot; or &quot;contact&quot;) associated with 
                  the youth group, which brings young people together in an informal 
                  setting, and also helps families and seniors.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Pável is 
                  now working with the Patronato as an administrative assistant, 
                  helping to organize events, conduct tours for visitors, help 
                  with supplying the pharmacy, organizing the library, and helping 
                  out on the various tasks that come up each day. He hopes to 
                  eventually get a computer so he can set up a database for the 
                  library's ten thousand books, and also create a list with information 
                  on the congregation's members.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Malu continues 
                  her journalism studies at the University of Havana, with an 
                  emphasis on cultural journalism. She has particpated in the 
                  &quot;Birthright&quot; program, which enabled her to visit Israel. 
                  &quot;There were ten of us on the trip,&quot; she says. &quot;It 
                  was one of the most exciting times of my life.&quot;<img src="art14.jpg" width="205" height="154" align="right" vspace="6" hspace="8" alt="Mar&iacute;a Luisa  Zay&oacute;n"></font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The Jewish 
                  youth group in Cuba has not always been strong. With the departure 
                  of over 90 percent of the Jewish populartion after 1959, the 
                  restrictions on religious practice until 1991, and the recent 
                  departure of several hundred individuals and families to Israel, 
                  the youth group struggled to keep going with just a few individuals.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;But 
                  now we're getting stronger,&quot; says Malu. &quot;<a href="nestor.html">Nestor 
                  and Mara</a> (assigned to Cuba by the JDC) have helped tremendously. 
                  The most important thing is now we have a youth organization. 
                  There are more coming in. Now they have a place to go.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;And 
                  there's more exchange with the outside world,&quot; adds Pável. 
                  &quot;We don't feel so isolated anymore.&quot;</font> <br>
