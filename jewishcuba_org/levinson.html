    <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Westview Publishing 
      is pleased to announce the release of Dr. Jay Levinson's new book,</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Jewish Community 
      of Cuba: The Golden Years, 1906-1958<br>
      Westview Publishing Co., Inc. (2006), 0-9776207-0-0, $24.95</strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In 1906 Manuel Hadida 
      convened a meeting of eleven Jews in his parlor. A relative of his had passed 
      away. The purpose of the gathering was to establish a synagogue and Jewish 
      burial ground for the one hundred or so &quot;Hebrew settlers&quot; in Cuba. 
      At another meeting not long afterwards officers were elected, but in the 
      Fall 1906 the newly elected treasurer also died. From this auspicious beginning, 
      the Cuban Jewish community reached 15,000 or more members at its zenith.<img src="levinson.jpg" width="150" height="221" hspace="8" vspace="8" align="right"></font></p>
    <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This book traces the 
      history of that community, reconstructing many events which have been forgotten. 
      The island's first rabbi made trips to Santiago de Cuba and Havana from 
      Florida, where he owned an ice cream factory. During World War II kosher 
      meat was slaughtered in Cuba for soldiers in the U.S. Army. Meyer Lansky, 
      known for his underworld activities, applied for membership in a Havana 
      synagogue.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The book also brings 
      new understanding to more well-known history. The refusal of the Cuban government 
      to allow the St. Louis to disembark passengers is examined in light of the 
      flight of Jews from Nazi Europe, particularly to Mandate Palestine, where 
      British immigration policy was changing (unknown to the Cubans). The building 
      of new synagogues on the eve of the Revolution is considered in the context 
      of nouveau riche and the move to suburbia.</font></p>
