 (ritual    circumcision) on 14 members of our community, 6 of whom were children. The last brit milah    had been performed in Santiago de Cuba 20 years earlier.</font></td>

<p>Only a week later, six of these men were married under the <strong><em>chuppah</em></strong>  (wedding canopy).
 Rabbis Claudio Kaiser and Alejandro Felch who had converted various  members of the community days earlier were in charge of sanctifying these couples in holy  matrimony. </p>  
<p>In December 1996, after a year of intensive activities, Andres Novoa Alvarez and  Roberto Novoa Bonne, under rabbinical supervision, celebrated their <strong><em>bar  mitzvah</em></strong>.
 Their preparation time was short but their accomplishments were  great.
 This event was remarkable because it had been 33 years since the last bar mitzvah  in Santiago. It was an especially joyous time. </p>  
<p>In 1996, Rebeca Botton, president of the community, had the honor to be invited to  participate in an International Congress of women in Israel where she was given the
  &quot;Lion of Judah&quot; award. </font></p>  <div align="center"><center><table border="0" width="445">    <tr>      <td width="161">

In July 1997 a young man from our community, Marcos Frómeta Farin,
 together with two young people from Havana accompanied Dr. Jose Miller as the Cuban Delegation to the <strong><em>Macabbiah Games</em></strong> in Israel.
 Marcos      had the honor of carrying the Cuban flag.</font></td>    </tr>  </table>  </center></div><font SIZE="4">
<p>In August, 1997, Andres Novoa Castiel and Jorge Rivero  Behar attended the 22<sup>nd</sup> Conference of <strong><em>CAJE</em></strong>
 (Coalition  for the Advancement of Jewish education) in Stanford, California through an invitation by <strong><em>Congregation  Netivot Shalom </em></strong>in Berkeley, California.</p>

<p>On October 20, 1997, we celebrated the publication of the history of our community <strong><em>&quot;Sinagoga  de Santiago de Cuba&quot;</em></strong>
 (The Synagogue of Santiago de Cuba) by Eugenia  Farin Levy.</p>  

<p>Just a few days later, Eugenia Farin Levy, vice president of the community, travelled as a delegate to the 6<sup>th</sup> meeting of Latin American Women Directors of Jewish
  Institutions which took place in Mar del Plata, Argentina.</font>

<p>On the 7<sup>th</sup> of November, Señora Farin brought back a sefer Torah which had been kept in the Adath Israel Synagogue in Havana.
 This Torah had  originally arrived in our city at the beginning of the century.
 The founders of our  community had brought it from Turkey.
 We believe that it must be more than a century old.</p>  </font>
