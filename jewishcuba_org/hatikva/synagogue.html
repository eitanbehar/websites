<p>For two years we carried on our communal activities in the home of  Rebeca Botton Behar, president of our emerging community. We celebrated our Jewish  holidays there.</font></p>

  <p>July 25, 1995 was the special day on which we reopened the doors of our old Synagogue.
  It coincided with the day Santiago was celebrating the 480<sup>th</sup>
 anniversary of its  founding. The Synagogue was dedicated by Rabbi Sh&#146;muel Szteinhendler.
 After many  years of silence we were able to listen to the sound of the <em><strong>shofar</strong></em>  announcing loudly to all the descendants of Abraham that the people of Israel were alive  in Santiago de Cuba! </p> 

 <p>Due to our great desire to learn the language, traditions, religion and culture of our  ancestors, many of us are now able to read <strong><em>Torah</em></strong> and lead  religious services.</p>

<p>A team of <strong><em>morim</em></strong> and <strong><em>madrichim</em></strong>  (teachers and counselors) are responsible for guiding the community which currently has a  Hebrew school.
 It is customary in our synagogue every <strong><em>Shabbat</em></strong>
  afternoon after morning <strong><em>Shajarit</em></strong> services to share a kiddush  lunch and to study the weekly parsha (Torah portion). By enriching our Jewish learning, we  are able to motivate all the members of our community. </p>  

<p>In the cultural realm, we have formed two dance groups, which perform a wide repertoire  of Israeli folk dances: a youth group called <strong><em>Atideinu</em></strong> (&quot;Our  Future&quot;) and a children&#146;s troupe 
<strong><em>Etzim Ktanim</em></strong>  (&quot;Little Trees&quot;). </p>  

<p>Life in <strong><em>HATIKVAH</em></strong> is filled with enjoyable moments. The  activities and the time we spend together are growing all the time. </p> 

 <p>We have progressed a lot. As in the story of <strong><em>Chanukah</em></strong>,
 we  have had a miracle here and the flame of Judaism again shines brightly in our synagogue.  Let it always be so. <strong><em>AMEN SELA</em></strong>.</font></p>
