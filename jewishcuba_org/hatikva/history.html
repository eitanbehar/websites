    1924. It was called <em><strong>Sociedad Union Israelita de Oriente de Cuba</strong></em>

    (the Jewish Society of Eastern Cuba). That institution was located in a rented space until

    1939 when a new house was built. It was thereafter called the Sinagoga de Santiago de Cuba

    (the Synagogue of Santiago de Cuba) and the congregation relocated there. </font></td>

    Jewish Society of Eastern Cuba consisted mainly of Sephardic families from Turkey. They

    arrived at the beginning of the century bringing with them their customs, traditions and

    the language of Ladino or Judeo-Spanish. They came hoping to better themselves

    economically and they have worked hard since their arrival to achieve this goal.</font></td>

  <font SIZE="4"><p>At the beginning of World War II, various Ashkenazi families mainly from

  Poland, arrived in Santiago who were fleeing the Nazi horrors. In Santiago it became

  customary to refer to all Jews as &quot;Polacos &quot; (&quot;Poles&quot;).</p>

  <p>The Society remained active until 1959. Due to the emigration of many of its members to

  the United States, in the 1960&#146;s, the community cut back its activities until it

  closed down in 1980.</font></p>
