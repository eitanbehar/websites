              <h1>Communities reclaim property as local Jewish needs multiply</h1>
              <b>(A Cuban Revival, Part 2)</b> 
              <h3>By Kenneth Bandler</h3>
              <p>HAVANA (JTA) -- On a Saturday morning in early December, about 
                a week before Chanukah, Sephardi Jews here gather to celebrate 
                what they consider their own miracle. 
              <p> 
              <p>For the first time in many years, Shabbat services are being 
                held at the Sephardic Jewish Center. The event marks the culmination 
                of two years of negotiations to regain possession of the building. 
              <p>Unable to maintain the building after the mass exodus of thousands 
                of Cuban Jews after the 1959 revolution, most of the building 
                was rented to cultural organizations. 
              <p>Sephardi Jews were left with only a small chapel and an office. 
              <p>``The situation was not easy, but being Jewish, we had the courage 
                to go forth in any situation,'' says Yosef Levy, president of 
                the Sephardi center. 
              <p>Unlike the experiences of Jewish communities in European Communist 
                countries, communal property here was not seized by the government, 
                Cuban Jewish leaders point out. 
              <p>And, they say, the government is supportive of efforts to reclaim 
                property for communal use. 
              <p>Nonetheless, such efforts are difficult when the current occupants 
                are reluctant to move or need time to find alternative quarters. 
                The recovery of the Sephardi center occurred room by room over 
                two years. 
              <p>Also last year, in Santiago de Cuba, a five-hour bus ride from 
                Havana, the municipality returned the synagogue to the 100-member 
                Jewish community. 
              <p>The transfer relieved Rebecca Botton, president of the Santiago 
                Jewish community, of the burden of hosting 50 people in her home 
                every Shabbat for services. 
              <p>Encouraged by these successful efforts at property restitution, 
                Jewish communities across the country are pursuing claims as well. 
              <p>Before the revolution, a large building adjacent to the Ashkenazi-dominated 
                Patronato, Havana's main synagogue, housed a Jewish community 
                center and day school. It was rented to the Cuban Ministry of 
                Culture in the 1960s and was sold in 1987. 
              <p>Now, with the community forced to use the sanctuary's balcony 
                for renewed Sunday school classes, the Jews here would like to 
                see the synagogue's annex returned. 
              <p>``I thought that before I die this part of the building would 
                be recovered by the Jewish community,'' says Adela Dworin, vice 
                president of the Jewish community here. 
              <p>The rush to reclaim property is seen as a necessity as Jewish 
                life is once again flourishing here. 
              <p>The community, numbering about 2,000 people, has nearly tripled 
                in size since the enactment of a 1991 law allowing Cubans to be 
                members of the ruling Communist Party and participate in religious 
                associations. 
              <p>As the community rebuilds its institutions, one of the primary 
                services functioning since 1991 is a pharmacy at the Patronato. 
              <p>Created with the assistance of the American Jewish Joint Distribution 
                Committee, the pharmacy dispenses medication to Jews weekly. It 
                also cooperates with a Catholic-run pharmacy to provide some medications 
                to non-Jews. 
              <p>The pharmacy, however, could not stock medicine requiring refrigeration 
                because the community could not afford to purchase a refrigerator. 
                Donations from participants in a recent JDC board mission here 
                will be used to make that purchase. 
              <p>As the community has expanded, the deepening of Jewish identity 
                has led some Jews to choose aliyah. 
              <p>After a recent Kabalat Shabbat service at the Patronato, two 
                young Cubans asked an American visitor questions about life in 
                Israel. They were preparing to leave within weeks. 
              <p>Emigration to Israel happens discreetly, and those who are familiar 
                with Cuban aliyah will not discuss precise numbers. 
              <p>However, one source estimated that as much as 20 percent of the 
                community probably would leave for Israel in the near future. 
              <p> 
              <p>Officials of the JDC, which has maintained a presence here during 
                the past four years, will not comment on aliyah. 
              <p>They stress that their work in Cuba, as in other countries around 
                the world, focuses on community development and leadership training 
                aimed at ensuring the future of Cuban Jewry. 
              <p>Dworin is more forthright. ``Leaving is a national problem,''she 
                says, adding that a sizable minority of the general Cuban population 
                wants to emigrate. 
              <p>Economic hardship is one primary motivation. 
              <p>Cubans have the highest literacy rate in Latin America, and in 
                the Jewish population, professions such as doctors and engineers 
                are dominant. 
              <p> ``In the 1960s, my father said, `One day you will wait in line 
                for a piece of bread,' '' says Dworin. ``I did not believe him 
                then, but now I have to do that.'' 
              <p>In a country where even the mayor of the capital city admits 
                that more than half of the buildings are in urgent need of repair, 
                where public transportation is sporadic and overcrowded, where 
                food and household supplies are rationed and where the average 
                monthly salary is about $12, the allure of the revolution's goals 
                to realize a better society has faded. 
              <p>Cubans openly joke about it. 
              <p>``Cuba has the best ice cream in the world and the worst spoon'' 
                is one of the widely used idioms. It refers to Copellio, the island's 
                sole producer of ice cream, which is available in limited quantities 
                and therefore difficult to eat. 
              <p>For members of the Jewish community, however, there is one distinct 
                exception to the ration list -- access to kosher meat. 
              <p>In a society where any meat is scarce, this accommodation is 
                arranged by Castro's government, whose officials allow the country's 
                one kosher butcher to select the cows to use for ritual slaughter, 
                according to Jewish communal leaders. 
              <p>However, because of limited supplies, not every family in the 
                growing community can take advantage of this arrangement. The 
                list of those entitled to kosher meat is limited to only 140 families 
                out of 400 in Havana, says Sephardi Jewish leader Levy. 
              <p>Still, the kashrut accommodation as well as the openness to property 
                restitution are seen as clear examples of the absence of anti-Semitism 
                in this society. 
              <p>The butcher, housed in a storefront with Jewish stars on its 
                gates, is located in Old Havana amid the decaying buildings where 
                many of the city's poorest live in severely overcrowded homes. 
              <p> 
              <p>At one time, the area was populated by Jews, most of whom either 
                emigrated or moved to such middle-class neighborhoods as Vedado, 
                where the Patronato stands. 
              <p>A short walk from the butcher is the country's oldest synagogue, 
                Chevet Achim. 
              <p>Founded in 1914 by a Turkish Jewish barkeeper -- the bar still 
                stands in the front room at the top of the staircase leading to 
                the synagogue -- Chevet Achim was closed last summer because the 
                roof leaks and the adjoining building is in danger of collapsing. 
              <p>Because most Jews do not live in this area, the community has 
                all but given up on the idea of restoring the building for daily 
                use as a synagogue. 
              <p>But community leaders are eager to make sure that Chevet Achim, 
                like other communal properties being reclaimed, is preserved for 
                future generations. 
              <p>``Inside these walls the Sephardic Jews lived the best years 
                of their lives,'' says Levy, expressing the hope that the building 
                would be transformed into a museum of Jewish life in Cuba. 
              <p> 
              <p> 
              <p>Community leaders, as well as JDC officials, are confident that 
                the majority of Cuban Jews will remain, and they are looking ahead 
                to continue the work of rebuilding and organizing Cuban Jewry. 
              <p>``They started from scratch and are really building up a society 
                in every sense of the word,'' says Ambassador Milton Wolf, president 
                of the JDC, who is a former U.S. envoy to Austria. 
              <p>``This community that was almost dying is alive and strong in 
                its potential,'' says Jorge Dinier, who recently completed a two-year 
                posting here as the coordinator of JDC programs in Cuba. 
              <p> 
              <p>During the past four years, Cuban Jewry has experienced a``change 
                from a culture of survival to a culture of community,'' he says. 
              <p>Plans are under way to reinforce the spirit of community by connecting 
                all Cuba's Jewish communities via an electronic information-sharing 
                network. 
              <p>Such technology, Dinier says, would be used to connect Cuban 
                Jews with other Jewish communities around the world. <br>
