                        pesos?</strong></p>
                    <p>You can change dollars into pesos at CADECA (Casa de Cambio
                      / Exchange House), at some banks, and at hotel front desks.
                      Don't change with people in the street, it's not legal.
                      Lately the exchange rate has been stable at 1 dollar =
                      25 pesos. Dollars cannot be used anymore for purchasing
                      items in Cuba. &nbsp;You must change money. When changing
                      money, you will be given tourist convertible pesos rather
                      than the national peso. &nbsp;It is traded at one CUC for
                      each dollar. &nbsp;However, there is a 20% surcharge. &nbsp;If
                      you change other national currencies to CUC, you will be
                      charged 8 to 10% surcharge. &nbsp; Tourists changing pesos
                      back to dollars do so at 1 to1.</p>
                    <div>
                      <p><strong>I've heard there are two different kind of pesos.
                          Is this true?</strong></p>
                      <p>There is a little confusion regarding currencies in
                        Cuba. There are two currencies in Cuba now:&nbsp;<br>
                          <strong>Convertible</strong>&nbsp;Cuban Peso&nbsp;<strong>(CUC)</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<strong>1</strong>&nbsp;ccp
                          = 1 usd&nbsp;<br>
                        <strong>Domestic</strong>&nbsp;Cuban Peso&nbsp;<strong>(CUP</strong>)
                        -&nbsp;<strong>25</strong>&nbsp;cup = 1 usd</p>
                      <p>The CUC is the equivalent of 80% of an American dollar.
                        The Domestic Cuban Peso (CUP) is used by the population
                        to buy all goods and pay all services. It s also used
                        by the government owned companies. When you visit an
                        exchange house with dollars (usd) you leave with pesos
                        (cup). You can use pesos (cup) to buy in the farmers'
                        market, or pay public transportation. Most of the tourists
                        don't use pesos, just CUCs. But certain type of tourists
                        enjoy buying in the farmers' marker, or taking buses
                        instead of taxis, and they'll need pesos. You can use
                        pesos also to buy books. 90% of goods in Cuba can be
                        obtained with tourist pesos.</p>
                      <p><strong>How much money should I anticipate spending
                          each day, for everything?</strong></p>
                      <p>If you are staying at a "tourist hotel" about $200 per
                        day should be enough. If you are the type traveling with
                        a backpack, staying in private houses, and buying food
                        in pesos, from $30 to $50 depending on where you are.
                        (Cities are more expensive.) Buying a package tour will
                        of course reduce the amount of cash needed daily. Carrying
                        traveler's checks is better than carrying cash, but have
                        enough cash for meals and taxis. You may cash travelers
                        checks drawn on U.S. banks at most banks or hotel front
                        desks.</p>
                      <p><strong>Can I use my credit card?</strong></p>
                      <p>If you are a citizen of the U.S. you cannot use your
                        credit card(s) in Cuba. Only non-U.S. credit cards are
                        accepted. Banks and hotels accept Travelers Checks from
                        all countries. &nbsp;It doesn't matter what your citizenship
                        is for using credit cards in Cuba. Some people have bank
                        accounts in England, Mexico, Canada, Israel, etc. Even
                        if they are U.S. citizens, they can use these cards. &nbsp;However,
                        there are very few establishments that accept credit
                        cards. &nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Mostly any bank and stores in shopping malls in major
                          cities will accept non-U.S. credit cards.</p>
                        <p><strong>Where can I cash my travelers checks?</strong></p>
                        <p>Banks and hotels. Banks are less friendly, but you'll
                          pay less.</p>
                        <p><strong>Where can I cash my American Express travelers
                            checks which are from a United States bank?</strong></p>
                        <p>There are many banks which will cash these checks. &nbsp;One
                          is at the Hotel Nacional on the mezzanine. &nbsp; There
                          are also many hotels which will cash AmEx checks from

              <p>  Yes. You can go legal, illegal 
                or semi-legal. Legal is when you stay in a house paying taxes
                to the government. They must have an inscription in the front
                of the house. Illegal is when you stay in a house where the owner
                pays nothing to the government. Semi-legal is if you stay in
                some friend's house. Technically your friend should report to
                the Immigration Office that there is a foreigner in his/her house,
                and prove there is a close friendship or that the person is a
                member of the family. There is also a $40 stamp you must get
                in your passport. (Most of the people don't do that, and stay
                semi-legally.) We recommend staying only in legal places or with
                friends. Prices vary from 15 to 35 per day. </p>

              <p align="left"><b>Is it legal for 
                United States citizens to travel to Cuba?</b></p>
              <p align="left">Yes. There are several

                Even U.S. citizens going on their own through Canada, Mexico, 
                etc., have reported few problems upon returning. If you take the 
                independent route, however, we recommend not showing up at U.S. 
                customs with your pockets or suitcases stuffed with Cuban cigars, 
                which are illegal to import. You can stay within the law even 
                by going on your own. Just be sure you know what the law is.</p>

              <p align="left">Based on the reports 
                of travelers going with groups associated with us, Cuba is one 
                of the safest countries to visit. Recently there have been reports 
                of the theft of items left untended in the tourist areas, similar 
                to other tourist areas around the world.</p>

              <p> Yes, but hiring a car is not recommended
                  for getting around the city of Havana. The roads are badly
                  signed and there have been many accidents with tourists driving
                  rental cars. Here are two places 
                where you can rent a car: <br>
                <br>
                Havanautos, Calle 36 505 entre 5 y 5a, Miramar, T 332369, F 331416 
                <br>
                Transautos, Calle 21 entre N y O, Vedado, next to Hotel Capri. 
              <p> <b>How do I get to and from the 
                airport? </b>  
              <p> José Martí Airport is 18 km from
                  Havana. Turistaxi costs US$16-25 depending on time of day or
                  night and destination. Panataxi 
                are US$12-16. The Cubatur 
                desk will book a taxi for you from the airport. The return journey
                in a private taxi could cost as little as US$10, but don't count
                on it. City buses run from 
                Terminal 4 (Air Cubana terminal) to town, ask around. To the

              <p class="style1">  Yes. He will have a good time 
                having fun in the swimming pool in the hotel. But carry with
                you every single thing you need for the baby, including diapers
                and pediatric medicines. (The hotel pools are solar heated -
                by the sun, not panels - and can be cold. Check to see if the
                pool is too cold for a baby.) Some baby needs can be found in
                dollar stores, but it is best to be prepared by bringing what
                you need. </p>

                items should I take?</b>
              <p class="style1">Toilet paper, just in case. (This 
                applies to most countries outside the States.) Carry a couple 
                of face cloths with you if you like to use one when you bathe 
                or shower. </p>
              <p class="style1"><b>What other items are useful?</b></p>
              <p class="style1">Even if you are on a tour, it is 
                good to carry a beach towel. Always carry a sun hat, or an umbrella 
                for the sun or the extreme heat of the Oriente, sun guard, and 
                mosquito repellent.</p>
              <p class="style1"><b>Where is a good place to buy 
                souvenirs, music CDs, rum, and cigars? </b> </p>
              <p class="style1"> The duty free shop at the airport 
                is a very good value and saves you carrying these items while 
                you are in Cuba.  
              <p class="style1"><b>What's the electricity, 110 or 
                220?</b></p>
              <p class="style1"> Most of Cuba is 110 but the hotels 
                that have been refurbished by European companies usually are
                220. Bring your converter. Take a dual electricity hairdryer
                although most of the newer hotels have hairdryers. </p>
              <p class="style1"><b>Where do I go for good traditional 
                music? </b> 
          <p><span class="style1"> There are Casas de la Trova around 
            the country, they are houses where traditional Cuban music can be 
            heard for free or for a minimal charge, thoroughly rec. de la Cultura
