                JEWS SURVIVE YEARS IN THE REVOLUTIONARY DESERT</font></b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>By DAN FREEDMAN</b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><i>c.2000 Hearst Newspapers</i></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">HAVANA, Cuba: According to the Bible, 
                it took Moses 40 years to lead the ancient Hebrews out of the 
                desert and into the promised land - about the same amount of time 
                it has taken Cuba's small Jewish community to get back on its 
                feet under Communist rule. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Depleted by departures since Fidel 
                Castro seized power in 1959, Cuba's tiny Jewish population of 
                1,500 is rebuilding itself. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">The worship sanctuary at Havana's 
                main Jewish community center and synagogue, known as the Patronato, 
                has been renovated, largely with American donations. It is now 
                a warm and inviting place, hardly distinguishable from similar 
                spaces in suburban U.S. synagogues. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">For decades it had been a wreck. 
                Tiles were falling from the ceiling, and birds, flying freely 
                in and out of broken windows, occasionally left their mark on 
                congregants below. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">The newly repaired sanctuary is 
                a fitting symbol of how far Cuba's Jewish population has traveled 
                in 41 years under Castro.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">``We are OK here,'' said Dr. Jose 
                Miller, 74, a retired surgeon who serves as the community's leader 
                in the absence of a full-time rabbi. ``There is no anti-Semitism. 
                We used to be isolated, but things have changed.'' </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">With a membership of 150 families, 
                the Patronato is the largest of Cuba's five synagogues. It sponsors 
                a religious school for children, a library, activities for senior 
                citizens and training for young adults to lead worship services. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">It also serves food after worship 
                services and doubles as a mini-pharmacy - important features in 
                a nation where food is rationed and medicine is scarce. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">A picture on the wall shows Castro 
                in his signature green fatigues posing with Miller at a 1998 party 
                celebrating Hanukkah, the 8-day Jewish festival of lights. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> The relationship was not always 
                so cozy. As a Communist state, Cuba officially opposed all forms 
                of organized religion. Churches and synagogues were not allowed 
                to operate religious schools of any kind. Declaring yourself a 
                ``believer'' was a sure way not to get the best jobs or admitted 
                to the best schools. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">All that changed in 1991 with the 
                downfall of the Soviet Union. Job applications and government 
                forms no longer asked questions about religious affiliation. Also, 
                the hard times and grinding shortages drove many people to seek 
                answers in religion - some if only to get a little extra food. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Before the 1959 revolution, Cuba 
                had a robust Jewish population of 15,000. Jews from Turkey and 
                other parts of the Middle East had settled there after World War 
                I. And European Jews fleeing Adolf Hitler before and during World 
                War II found refuge in Cuba. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> But when Castro declared the island 
                a Communist state and seized private businesses, the vast majority 
                of Jews began departing for the United States. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Adela Dworin, vice president at 
                the Patronato and chief librarian, was studying to be a lawyer 
                in 1961 when Castro seized her father's clothing factory. ``He 
                wanted to leave and I wanted to stay,'' she recalled in an interview. 
                ``He said, `If you're not leaving, then I'm staying too.''' </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Through the 1960s, Dworin bid goodbye 
                to virtually all her classmates and Jewish friends. She began 
                working in the Patronato library. ``Those were difficult years,'' 
                she said.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Through it all, a small number of 
                Jewish families continued to celebrate the Sabbath and Jewish 
                holidays. ``Someone had to stay here and maintain the traditions 
                of our community,'' Dworin said. ``I think I made the right choice.'' 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">For Jewish Cubans, the rebirth of 
                interest in religion over the past decade has yielded a mixture 
                of hope, challenge and disappointment. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Canadian shipments of matzoh, ritual 
                wine and other Passover holiday foods revitalized interest in 
                Jewish holidays.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">But the complexity of Kosher laws 
                governing food preparation, combined with the harsh realities 
                Cuba's erratic food supply, mean that while the synagogue does 
                not serve forbidden foods such as pork and shellfish, its meals 
                are ``not 100 percent Kosher,'' Dworin said. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">The new faces showing up at the 
                synagogue were not those of Jews returning to their roots but 
                those of Jews discovering them for the first time. Virtually all 
                had married non-Jews and knew little of Jewish ritual. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> ``If you asked them questions, 
                they didn't know,'' Dworin said. ``What's Shavuot? They didn't 
                know.'' (It is a Jewish holiday commemorating the revelation of 
                Jewish law at Mount Sinai.) </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Nevertheless, the synagogue was 
                a place to get help and advice and meet friends and for the young 
                a place to find a boyfriend or girlfriend. ``They feel like this 
                is their second home,'' Dworin said. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Instruction came from veterans such 
                as Dworin, as well as Jewish volunteers from the United States 
                and elsewhere. In 1995 a rabbi started commuting a few times a 
                year from Mexico, performing conversions of 300 non-Jewish family 
                members. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Some young adults became proficient 
                in reciting blessings and portions of Hebrew scripture. They were 
                designated to lead the congregation in worship. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">But many who received the training 
                decided to leave Cuba for Israel. About 400 Cuban Jews have departed 
                for Israel since 1994, a potentially devastating blow to a small 
                community. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">``It's been an up-and-down situation, 
                but when someone moves out, there's always someone there to move 
                in,'' said June Safran of Oakland, Calif., executive director 
                of the Cuba-America Jewish Mission, a people-to-people group. 
                Safran has led delegations of Jews mainly from California on trips 
                to establish relations with Cuban Jews. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">``I believe the community is going 
                to survive, and it will always be stronger than the period between 
                the '60s and the '90s.''</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">For Dworin, the dedication of the 
                Patronato's remodeled sanctuary last month went a long way toward 
                muting the years of turmoil. ``It was a dream come true,'' she 
                said.</font></p>
