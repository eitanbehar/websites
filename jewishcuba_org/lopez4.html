              <p><font size="-1" face="arial">Unaware that there is a vibrant 
                Cuban-Jewish community in Miami, Florida? So was Caroline Bettinger-Lopez 
                '01, despite growing up Jewish in a Miami suburb. </font></p>
              <font size="-1" face="arial"> 
              <P> Bettinger-Lopez was as surprised as anyone else to learn about 
                the community she didn't know existed. "I thought 'Wow-this is 
                fascinating,'" she said, "Who would've thought?" 
              <P> Now she's an expert on the subject. 
              <P> More than sixty people gathered at Columbia Bookstore this past 
                Thursday, December 30, to listen to Bettinger-Lopez discuss her 
                newly published book, Cuban-Jewish Journeys: Searching for Identity, 
                Home, and History in Miami. 
              <P> The book, the author's first, was published this fall by the 
                University of Tennessee Press. Bettinger-Lopez spent more than 
                an hour speaking about the book, showing slides and answering 
                questions from a largely enthusiastic, supportive group of listeners.<img src="carrie4.jpg" width="208" height="317" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="Caroline Bettinger Lopez"> 
              <P> The presentation and book signing focused on various diverse 
                elements of Cuban-Jewish identity in Miami, from architectural 
                similarities of Cuban-Jewish synagogues in Miami and Havana, to 
                interracial dating among Ashkenazic and Sephardic Jews, to the 
                term "Jewban"-a word embraced by the Cuban Jews to describe their 
                heritage. 
              <P> " 'Jewban' represents a new notion of community selfhood, a 
                confident group identity," Bettinger-Lopez said. "The term shows 
                Cuban Jews becoming more confident with themselves." A number 
                of the themes that Bettinger-Lopez writes about in Cuban-Jewish 
                Journeys, such as political activities among the Cuban-Jewish 
                community, and machismo culture among Cuban-Jewish males, were 
                brought to life at the book signing by Cuban-Jewish members of 
                the audience, who extemporaneously and passionately voiced their 
                own experiences and viewpoints. Bettinger-Lopez, who was an anthropology 
                major and honors student at the University of Michigan, began 
                the book as her senior thesis. "I stumbled upon the Cuban-Jewish 
                community while I was looking at issues of identity when I was 
                studying anthropology at Michigan," she says. 
              <P> "I was becoming really interested in identity with an on-the-ground 
                focus-not just theory," Bettinger-Lopez said, "and I decided to 
                go back home because I never knew this community existed." 
              <P> Bettinger-Lopez has received positive feedback from readers. 
                "The most popular chapters," she says, "are the personal ones 
                where I talk about my relationships and experiences with the community." 
              <P> She describes writing the book as "wonderful," and possibly 
                the most important experience of her life. 
              <P> Bettinger-Lopez says the most difficult aspect of writing the 
                book was listening to recent Cuban-Jewish arrivals talk about 
                their immigration difficulties. She felt guilty when interviewees 
                asked for legal assistance that she wasn't able to provide-and 
                those feelings played an important part in Bettinger-Lopez's decision 
                to attend law school. 
              <P> For that reason, Bettinger-Lopez hopes that publishing the words 
                of the Cuban-Jewish immigrants will have a positive effect. "Disseminating 
                the information is important," she said. 
              <P> For Bettinger-Lopez, and those who read her book, those words 
                can be an inspiration on many levels. "I keep remembering these 
                people's voices," Bettinger-Lopez says, "and that helps me put 
                everything in perspective."<br>
