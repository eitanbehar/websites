              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1" color="#287AA2"><b><font color="#0066CC">(Note: 
                Joan Shnier and Jake Chazan wrote to us before leaving for Cuba, 
                wanting to know if they could visit a synagogue in Havana although 
                they were staying in Varadero. The report below tells of their 
                experiences. There is much valuable advice here, including how 
                an overly-cautious tour representative can prevent first-time 
                visitors from having a full experience.)</font></b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Dear Richard: </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> My husband, Jake Chazan, forwarded 
                your exchange of email to me so that I could add a few comments 
                about our recent trip to Cuba. Now that we are back and have our 
                creature comforts (and heating), my perspective is much more positive.<b> 
                I think we may have been overly cautious</b>, but between what 
                we read in the tourist guide books and on internet and the briefing 
                by our tour rep, we were a bit frightened to strike out on our 
                own. For example, our tour rep advised us NOT to rent a car because 
                1)the cost of renting and of insurance is expensive and the rules 
                are very different than in Canada and the US and not always to 
                our advantage 2) service centers are few and far between and there 
                are relatively few motorists on the highways and should we run 
                into car trouble, it could take a long time to get help and if 
                it did arrive, they could just as easily try to harm us 3) we 
                were advised most definitely NOT to drive at night because at 
                night #2 is even more problematic. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> We were very disappointed that 
                we could not make it to the synagogue in Havana. The official, 
                government licensed taxis charged $90 each way and then we would 
                have had to pay for their time while they took us around Havana. 
                We were advised NOT to make a private deal with an unofficial 
                taxi or private person as this is illegal and could get the Cuban 
                driver into a great deal of trouble if caught. Not to mention 
                what might happen to us, although our rep did say that the government 
                is not usually interested in harassing tourists. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Nonetheless, the Montreal family 
                Jake mentioned to you did just that and <b>paid about $100 for 
                a return trip to Havana</b> where they managed to visit the Orthodox 
                shul and spend a short time with the chazan and his wife. There 
                is a local bus service to Havana that uses new and comfortable 
                buses and is more reasonable, but it only runs 3 x a day; the 
                one way trip is 3 hours, the last return from Havana is around 
                4 p.m., and it drops you off on the outskirts of Havana. So then 
                you have to make your own way into the city and back to the bus 
                stop. Our rep advised us NOT to take that bus and NOT to wander 
                around Havana alone. Although another person in our tour group 
                said he had been to Havana many times and wandered around everywhere, 
                our rep said that he has heard and had first hand experience with 
                many unpleasant situations and that contrary to the popular belief 
                that Cuba is a very safe place, many bad things happen and we 
                should be very cautious. He has lived in Cuba for 3 years and 
                seemed to know what's going on there. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> So, as you can imagine, we were 
                very reluctant to be adventurous. We took an organized tour to 
                Havana and only afterward learned that <b>it is possible to make 
                a deal with the tour operator</b> to take the bus in and be dropped 
                off and picked up at a designated spot on the tour. If we had 
                known that in advance, we may have left the tour for a while, 
                gone to the shul and then joined up with it again for the return 
                trip. I don't know if the cost would be less than for the complete 
                tour. The tour cost $63 per person including lunch, and they may 
                have charged less just for the transportation. That's another 
                option to look into. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> We stayed at the Arenas Blancas 
                hotel on Varadero. It had a good location within easy walking 
                distance from the town of Varadero. The hotel was very clean, 
                but the food was another matter. It was plentiful and I'm sure 
                it was all very sanitary although since we didn't eat the pork, 
                and <b>many of the side dishes also contained pork</b>, not to 
                mention the fact that the rest was not very appetizing, it was 
                not a gourmet experience. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> And I guess you know that<b> in 
                Cuba, you take what you can get</b>, so in the morning you may 
                get a grilled cheese sandwich on white bread and in the afternoon 
                you might get it on a hamburger bun, or a hunk of French loaf, 
                or a hotdog bun. To be fair, there was always chicken, usually 
                a fish dish, many times they had seafood, lobster, shrimp, but 
                as we had been cautioned against eating the shellfish etc., we 
                didn't eat it. We were told that the water in Cuba, at least at 
                the resort was safe to drink. The hotel has some kind of filtered 
                water and we drank it with no ill effects. However our rep advised 
                us to drink only bottled water and NOT to drink the tap water, 
                especially the children, although he himself drinks it. They also 
                advised us that to be really safe, we should only drink carbonated 
                water since the carbonation process kills all bacteria. Even the 
                bottled non carbonated water is sometimes suspect, although we 
                drank it and didn't get sick. He also told us not to eat the fresh 
                salads so we didn't, but we noticed that most people did and did 
                not get sick. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Our rep told us that the food in 
                the restaurants outside the hotel was not much better, but the 
                couple of times we did eat out of the hotel, the food was considerably 
                better, or maybe we were just starving and it seemed that way. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> <b>Believe it or not, Cuba is very 
                expensive</b>. Or at least it seemed so to us who use a very devalued 
                Canadian dollar. The local taxis in Varadero charged $1.00 per 
                kilometer so if you lived in one of the hotels at the far end 
                of the strip away from the town and you wanted to go into town 
                every day, it could cost you $20.00 for a return cab ride every 
                day. In Havana they are renovating the old city and some of the 
                restaurants there are charging premium prices. For example, a 
                main course could cost between $16.00 and $25.00. That may seem 
                normal for a big US city, but in Cuba, I think people expect some 
                value for their money. </font></p>
              <p> <font face="Arial" size="-1">I keep remembering little details 
                from our trip that might be useful. When you need to use a washroom 
                in a public place outside your hotel, there are restroom attendants 
                who will demand payment for about <b>4 squares</b> of toilet paper. 
                They can be quite insistent. One female attendant in one of the 
                museums actually hissed to get my attention when I walked into 
                the bathroom without first putting money in her dish. My advice 
                is: ALWAYS carry your own toilet paper when you leave your hotel. 
                Try to have small change to put in the dish, otherwise you will 
                be paying a dollar each time you use the bathroom. If you don´t 
                have change, don´t be embarrassed to take change from the dish. 
                Don´t worry about the currency of the change because you can just 
                recycle it on your next stop. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> I don't know if all the precautionary 
                advice is in fact warranted, but you can imagine that we felt 
                very nervous about doing any exploring. Which is a great pity 
                because I realized when we were in Havana that it must have been 
                a spectacular city in its heyday. They are beginning to renovate 
                Old Havana and the old colonial buildings are magnificent. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> <b>I can't really understand why 
                our rep was so cautious. Bad things happen everywhere, as you 
                say, even in Toronto!!! But then again, maybe he knows something 
                we don't. It is his job after all. The next time I go though, 
                I will not be so timid. </b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> I just thought of one other piece 
                of information which might be useful. Before we left we read that 
                American Express travellers cheques were not accepted, so we ran 
                all over town to get Master Card cheques. But when we arrived, 
                we were told that they are accepted at banks and hotels because 
                they can change them through Canadian banks. I don't know if the 
                Amex cheques we get here are different than the ones issued in 
                the States, but if they are not, then Americans can take them. 
                <b>The other thought that ocurred to me was that Americans who 
                plan to travel frequently to Cuba should apply for a Canadian 
                credit card</b>, if they haven't already done so. We didn't actually 
                cash our travellers cheques because they take such a high commission, 
                around 4% we were told, and between our cash and credit cards 
                we were well covered. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Another bit of info that I left 
                out was that the Montreal family we met brought down a <b>whole 
                suitcase full of kosher food</b>, including milk, which they froze 
                and defrosted when they arrived. I don't know how they managed 
                to get it into the country, because I thought you are never allowed 
                to bring in food, but maybe that only applies to fresh fruits 
                and vegetables. They brought in cold cuts, cheese, peanut butter, 
                bread, hot dogs, cereal, you name it. I don't think I would recommend 
                it, but after our gastronimic experience, it doesn't seem to be 
                such a bad option. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> I also just remembered this detail. 
                We had US family on our flight from Toronto. Two grown sons and 
                their elderly parents. The children wanted to be able to keep 
                tabs on the parents so they brought along a walkie talkie. Also 
                a laptop. <b>These were both confiscated on arrival </b>and they 
                held up our bus to the hotel for nearly an hour doing the paperwork. 
                They were told they would get the items back when they left, but 
                I don't know if they did. So be careful what you bring in, because 
                they take their restrictions seriously it seems. <br>
