                  <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    In reading this presentation, I invite you to a moment of 
                    reflection. At the present time we should look towards the 
                    past as a reminder of what the future should be. Our ancestors 
                    were enslaved for centuries. They suffered the de-humanization 
                    and re-humanization strategies of the colonial Spanish power 
                    as established in Cuba. Their basic human right of religious 
                    freedom was outlawed. Abolishment of slavery ending in 1886 
                    was indeed a turning point towards the right direction. Cuba&#146;s 
                    republican era presented a Constitutional right of religious 
                    freedom. Yet, our religion remained stigmatized as a primitive 
                    cult, never to be recognized as a religion up to 1959. What 
                    has really changed during the Castro regime?</font> </p>
                  <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
                    feel compelled to say, nothing much has changed. By 1965 many 
                    of our priests and priestesses were subjected to forced labor 
                    camps for rejecting participation in the newly formed Conjunto 
                    Folklorico Nacional. Our religion was to be forcefully sold 
                    as folklore to tourist. The 70s were a period of religious 
                    repression where many were taken to jail and had their religious 
                    belongings confiscated. Later our people were forced to request 
                    government permits every time to engage in religious practice. 
                    Ordinations of minors were outlawed, and practitioners could 
                    not hold a government job in an overnight atheist country. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Again 
                    our religion was forced underground in many respects. Religious 
                    counseling, a basic human right of speech, was also restricted. 
                    Religious advice that may be perceived as conflictive with 
                    governmental interest became punishable. Priests were humiliated 
                    in Cuban prisons for years. Not one single organization has 
                    ever spoken of them. We do not know how many are still in 
                    Cuba&#146;s prisons. </font></p>
                  <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Suddenly 
                    a new possibility came in the 80s.</font> </p>
                  <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                    exodus of the labeled Marielito&#146;s shocked South Florida,with 
                    thousands of new arrivals many of whom came from Castro's 
                    prisons and mental institutions. Under the new stereotype 
                    our priests and priestesses were also considered Escoria-Scums. 
                    Our community rushed to their assistance and integrated them 
                    without seeking outside resources and media glorifications. 
                    It was our duty to do this because they are part of our religious 
                    community.</font> </p>
                  <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Little 
                    did they know that their religion in the US would soon be 
                    viewed as organized crime and be targeted by animal rights 
                    activists. By 1985 our religion in South Florida was experiencing 
                    the wrath of law enforcement for practicing animal offerings. 
                    Ordination rites to the priesthood were being raided; our 
                    sacred rooms and religious icons were damaged, our priests 
                    were charged with animal cruelty, and described in the media 
                    as an unwelcome cult. When the first Church of the Lukumi 
                    Babalu Aye tried to open its place of worship in the City 
                    of Hialeah in 1987, it was met with a unanimous opposition 
                    of City politicians, joined by the Christian community. Politicians 
                    proclaimed that they would not allow this cult in their city. 
                    The Christians paraded in front of the media singing hymns 
                    and waving placards saying &quot;Christ for Hialeah only&quot;, 
                    and called us devil worshippers. The new Catholic policy in 
                    Miami became anti-syncretic. Our people were no longer welcomed 
                    in their churches. </font> </p>
                  <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cuba 
                    was ready for another challenge. Negotiations were on their 
                    way with Nigeria, Africa, the birth land of our faith. The 
                    ooni ofIle Ife, a pope-like figure of the Yoruba faith, expressed 
                    his interest to visit Cuba and meet with the religious descendents, 
                    the Santeros (a colonial misnomer). Cuba welcomed the ooni 
                    disguised as cultural exchange. Cuba&#146;s interest was not 
                    just a new form of religious exploitation; they were looking 
                    for deals on Nigerian oil. Cuba allowed our senior Ifa priests 
                    to establish an organization named&#160;<font color="#000088">Ifa 
                    yesterday, Ifa today, Ifa tomorrow.</font> The purpose of 
                    the organization was to establish an apolitical exchange. 
                    Once the ooni left Cuba, government intervention caused the 
                    organization to collapse and a new government cultural organization 
                    emerged, the now called&#160;<font color="#000088">Asociacion 
                    Cultural Yorubade Cuba.</font></font> </p>
                  <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Plagued 
                    by decades of government manipulations, our religion in Cuba 
                    has been presented as one in support of the regime, and as 
                    a syncretic cult. Unlike its counterpart in the US, the Catholic 
                    Church of Cuba continues to promote syncretism in order to 
                    display popular support for their faith. The Cuban church 
                    attracts our people through humanitarian aid and syncretic 
                    tolerance. At one point, they even invited our Bata drummers 
                    to play at one Church using it as propaganda. </font> </p>
                  <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                    trend of the 90s is most interesting. In June 1993, the first 
                    Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye won in the US Supreme Court 
                    with a unanimous decision. Our religious practices are finally 
                    recognized and the Church has re-opened in the city of Hialeah. 
                    On the other hand, our priests are not recognized in Cuba. 
                    They cannot travel to the US with a religious visa, while 
                    Catholics and others can. This has provided a foundation to 
                    a new phenomenon, &quot;las mulas&quot;, the mules; these 
                    are a new breed of persons that travel to Cuba as couriers 
                    supplyingCuba&#146;s religious and general material needs. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
                    had the Guantanamo experience.<img src="chango2.jpg" align=RIGHT width=144 height=230> 
                    On that highly populated military base filled with our priests 
                    and practitioners, their religious belongings were disposed 
                    of, and only Christian missions were permitted. Those arriving 
                    at the shores of South Florida were forced to leave their 
                    religious belongings behind by US Officials. Not one word 
                    has ever been publicly spoken of such violations. We now face 
                    the rising trend of flying to Cuba for ordination rites and 
                    other ceremonies: many have had the "irreligious" belongings 
                    disposed of on return by US Officials and Bahamian Officials. 
                    No other religion has reported a similar incident. </font> 
                  </p>
                  <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                    Cuban Catholic Church has been engaged in a millionaire&#146;s 
                    restoration process of their assets. The government has not 
                    granted the right to form an apolitical Lukumi Church in Cuba. 
                    Similar to colonialism with the Cabildos, the government only 
                    grants token cultural associations with restrictive parameters 
                    that serve government interest. </font></p>
                  <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                    Vatican and the Cuban Church in my point of view are challenged 
                    by the implementation of a Redemptive Movement. In religious 
                    politics this means that a process of re-colonialism is now 
                    present, where religion attempts to change the people over 
                    a long period of time, and avoids changing the political order. 
                    To do this, they must make numerous concessions and out-live 
                    the existing political structure. The reward is a new opportunity 
                    for Cuba&#146;s Catholic Church to re-position itself in the 
                    future political and social power structure. The Church can 
                    easily accomplish this goal because it is a State and a religious 
                    entity.</font></p>
                  <p> <font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    In conclusion, I present my theory on &quot;when the wall 
                    comes down&quot; and the movement towards a new democratic 
                    Cuba. Although the Lukumi/Ayoba represents the overwhelming 
                    majority of the Cuban people, our political limitations are 
                    severe. Presently, this provides the Cuban Catholic Church 
                    with an open playing field to re-colonialize Cuba. A redemption 
                    movement would require a popular centralization source, which 
                    the Church can provide and maintain by sponsoring syncretism. 
                    The infrastructure is provided by the established Churches 
                    throughout the national territory. </font></p>
                  <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Concessions 
                    have been made by the Cuban government, which allows the Church 
                    to open numerous social work centers and organize humanitarian 
                    aid. The Vatican in this respect can negotiate with the US 
                    government and acquire concessions based on a viable peaceful 
                    transition towards democracy. This places the Church in a 
                    unique position benefiting from both Countries as mediators. 
                    The Church will then have a direct influence in the re-shaping 
                    processes of the present and future Political and Social order.</font></p>
                  <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
                    my theory is correct, the Catholic Church of Cuba will secure 
                    its longstanding power base in Cuba&#146;s future, thanks 
                    to the religious fervor that was preserved by our Lukumi/Ayoba 
                    community during decades of atheist rule. When the wall comes 
                    down, our religious community will be mislead into the belief 
                    that the Pope and Church delivered democracy.</font> </p>
                  <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                    questions at this juncture are: Will the Lukumi of Cuba, which 
                    is in the majority today, have an equal representation in 
                    the political and social order in a new Democratic State? 
                    Will other religions have an equal representation as well?</font> 
                  </p>
                  <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
                    is my belief that during these next two years Cuban Government 
                    and Church relations will deliver important changes. Already 
                    we see the outspoken Catholic priests in the US and in Cuba 
                    curbed by the Vatican. A new breed of clergy are playing a 
                    supportive role in the redemptive movement. I predict in this 
                    theory that we can expect Immigration laws and applications 
                    to be more restrictive for the purpose of containment. A block 
                    of institutionalization attempts of our faith in Cuba will 
                    persist. This will be in hopes that our community would remain 
                    under control through the Catholic power structure. A feeling 
                    of commonality, return to traditions, reconciliation of all 
                    Cuban people&#146;s as Christians, and Afro-Cuban support 
                    during the Papal visit next year, is already part of the propaganda.</font> 
                  </p>
                  <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
                    proposal for a peaceful democratic Cuba is as follows: A re-conciliation 
                    of the Cuban people cannot be carried out by rules of marginalization. 
                    The assumption that Afro-Cubans are truly syncretic is erroneous. 
                    To believe that present-day Cuba is primarily Christian is 
                    an obvious error. </font></p>
                  <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
                    propose that all religious denominations in the US with adherents 
                    in Cuba first begin to practice democracy here. A religious 
                    counsel of denominations should be formed in the US. The council 
                    should engage the present and future concerns from the standpoint 
                    of equal representation for all religions. The setting of 
                    a foundation for religious freedoms for all is a requirement.

                  <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It&#146;s 
                    my belief that a council of churches for equal representation 
                    can be a powerful God loving statement of hope and believable 
                    reconciliation in principle. I challenge all ministers of 
                    God, regardless of their denominations, to take this step 
                    forward so that together, we can all transform, and birth 
                    a new peaceful democratic future for Cuba. I pray that &quot;when 
                    the wall comes down&quot; this time, it will be with respect 
                    for all faiths.</font></p>
