              <blockquote>
                <p> 
                <p><font size="3"> Alejo Carpentier, a French-Cuban novelist, 
                  wrote a book entitled <i>Viaje a la Semilla</i>, in which the 
                  story's main character travels backwards through time, moving 
                  from adulthood to the seed from which he came. For several years 
                  I also had been trying to find a way to return to Cuba, where 
                  I was born in 1956. In 1962, my family and I emigrated as refugees 
                  to the United States. Through the goodness of the HIAS and the 
                  Triester family, we found ourselves in Worcester, Massachusetts, 
                  surely no sister city to Havana and as foreign to my impressionable 
                  five year-old eyes as anything I had ever seen. After we settled, 
                  my mother insisted we speak only Spanish at home, for which 
                  I am grateful. </font>

                        had retained only some memories. But there are things 
                        about Cuba, its land, and its people, that are such an 
                        innate part of me that I instantly felt a sense of home 
                        upon seeing it for the first time in 35 years. </td>

                <p> 
                <p><font size="3"> In 1993, I entered the School of Sacred Music 
                  to begin my cantorial studies. While a first-year student in 
                  Israel, I began to read and hear information about the remaining 
                  Jewish community in Cuba, including articles written about rabbis 
                  from Mexico and Colombia who were traveling to Cuba to lend 
                  religious support. </font>
                <p><font size="3"> After making inquiries at several organizations, 
                  I received an invitation from Warren Eisenberg, the Director 
                  of the Center for Public Policy at B'nai Brith International 
                  in Washington, D.C., to join a humanitarian mission to Cuba 
                  during the last week of January, 1997. The purpose of the mission 
                  was to bring badly-needed medical supplies to the Jewish community 
                  and to meet with the community's leaders. I was invited to provide 
                  religious and cultural support by leading <i>Shabbat</i> services 
                  at the Patronato Synagogue in Havana, meeting with the children 
                  of the religious school, and presenting two recitals of Jewish 
                  music--one in Havana, and one in Santiago de Cuba in Oriente 
                  province at the far eastern extreme of the island. </font>
                <p><font size="3"> Nothing could have prepared me sufficiently 
                  for the voyage back to my childhood--a childhood from which 
                  I had retained only some memories. But there are things about 
                  Cuba, its land, and its people, that are such an innate part 
                  of me that I instantly felt a sense of home upon seeing it for 
                  the first time in 35 years. </font>
                <p><font size="3"> In the 1950's, before Castro came to power, 
                  there were almost 20,000 Jews in Cuba: a minority of Sephardic 
                  Jews, primarily of Turkish descent, who had been in Cuba for 
                  several hundred years, and a large number of Ashkenazic Jews 
                  who came from Eastern Europe (primarily Poland) mainly during 
                  the 1920's and 1930's. Today's Cuban-Jewish community consists 
                  of about 1,400 individuals, spread throughout the country. In 
                  the past few years, the Castro government has given the Jewish 
                  community increasing freedom to practice Judaism and has allowed 
                  60 families to emigrate to Israel. There are about 390 Jewish 
                  families in Havana and four active synagogues: the Ashkenazic 
                  Conservative (the Patronato), the Sephardic Conservative, the 
                  Ashkenazic Orthodox, and the Sephardic Orthodox. Dr. Jose Miller, 
                  the head of Cuba's Jewish community, met our group in Havana. 
                  Our group of 31 hailed primarily from Dallas and Washington, 
                  D.C., and included Tommy Baer, the president of B'nai B'rith 
                  International, and Ruth Padorr, a Cuban native from Chicago 
                  who sang with me during recitals. Together, we visited all of 
                  the synagogues, met with the members of the communities, prayed 
                  <i>Shacharit</i> in the Ashkenazic Orthodox synagogue and prayed 
                  together for Friday evening <i>Shabbat</i> services at the Patronato. 
                  </font>
                <p><font size="3"> Upon entering the lobby of the Patronato synagogue--where, 
                  long ago, members of my family were married and where I served 
                  as ring boy 36 years earlier--I noticed an inscription of my 
                  great uncle's name, Israel Ticochinsky, as one of the founders 
                  of the synagogue. Dr. Miller saw me notice this and told me 
                  that I had a second cousin, Yolanda, who still lived in Cuba 
                  and came to services every week. He put me in contact with her 
                  and we spent an amazing day together recreating my family's 
                  past. </font>
                <p><font size="3"> She took me to two places where I and my family 
                  once lived. The people living there now were charming, and invited 
                  us in for coffee. I actually remembered the layout of the last 
                  place we lived in before leaving Cuba. My father's clothing 
                  store was now a cafeteria, my grandmother's apartment was a 
                  restaurant and the school I attended was divided up into several 
                  apartments. </font>
                <p><font size="3"> Ruth Padorr and I performed in Santiago and 
                  gave another concert in the Patronato synagogue, accompanied 
                  by the pianist from the Havana Lyric Opera company. The services 
                  were memorable for several reasons: it was the first time I 
                  had prayed in Spanish (to my recollection), and I was leading 
                  services in the synagogue that my great-uncle helped found. 
                  The synagogue's beautiful purple tinted windows, high above 
                  the ark, were almost all broken, and various animals and birds 
                  had taken up residence in the sanctuary. I was overcome by the 
                  strange beauty of seeing birds fly overhead during the service. 
                  </font>
                <p><font size="3"> Exactly one week after we arrived, we left 
                  Havana and returned to our respective cities in the U.S. But 
                  I felt I had <i>returned</i>. If not quite to the seed, then 
                  at least to the point where recollection is more physical than 
                  verbal; to a place where, for better or for worse, I have attempted 
                  to recapture my feelings with words--words that can never be 
                  sufficient to explain what I felt. </font>
