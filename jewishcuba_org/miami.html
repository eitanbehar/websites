            to leave homes, Cuban Jews thrive in Miami</font></font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> <b>BY BETTY HEISLER-SAMUELS </b></font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> <i>Special to The Jewish Star Times</i> 
            </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Cuban Jews began arriving in Miami 
            in 1960 along with the mass exodus of Cubans seeking political asylum 
            in the United States after Fidel Castro's Communist takeover. </font><font face="Arial" size="-1">Jews 
            had emigrated to Cuba in the 1920s and 1930s when quotas to the U.S. 
            were cut sharply. By the coming of the Castro regime in 1959, they 
            comprised a respectable percentage of Cuba's business community. As 
            such, they were among the first victims of the revolution. </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> At first they came to Miami to wait 
            things out, hoping that American intervention would put an end to 
            what they considered unthinkable, a communist regime 90 miles away 
            from the U.S. But after the Bay of Pigs fiasco, they had no choice 
            but to start the painstaking task of rebuilding their lives and their 
            community. Today, there are about 2,500 Cuban Jewish households in 
            Miami-Dade County, according to an estimate by the Greater Miami Jewish 
            Federation. </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Unlike South American Jews, who later 
            emigrated with part of most of their assets, Cuban Jews, like the 
            rest of the country's bourgeois, were taken by surprise, many having 
            put little money out of the country. The beginning was hard and slow. 
            Many opened small shops in downtown Miami, trying to recreate the 
            style of commerce they knew on the island where Jews had shops in 
            certain streets of old Havana, mainly selling textiles and dry goods. 
            But business in downtown Miami was slow and only the strong survived. 
            Some people emigrated to Puerto Rico or New York. Others opened manufacturing 
            plants and slowly, as more Cubans moved to Miami, they started to 
            feed off their own markets until a new economy began to take shape. 
            </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> <b>PIONEER BANKER </b></font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Bernardo Benes was one of the first 
            Cuban Jews to become a banker in Miami when he joined Washington Federal 
            Savings and Loan in Miami Beach in the early 1960s. </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> ``Among the refugees was a strong professional 
            class, many of them bankers, and the American banks took advantage 
            of this new pool,'' Benes recalled. ``They in turn started bringing 
            in clients that they knew from home and the banking character of Miami 
            changed drastically.'' </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Later, Benes and Carlos Dascal, another 
            Cuban Jew, started Continental Bank, the first Cuban-owned bank in 
            the U.S. </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Socially the Cuban Jews felt a tremendous 
            need to affiliate. Their life in Cuba had been communal. Jews had 
            rarely wandered outside of the community's social circle. Benes said 
            that he and two friends approached a YMHA in Miami Beach and asked 
            to be allowed to use a room twice a week for social gatherings. ``They 
            agreed, with the condition that we pay their monthly electric bill,'' 
            Benes said. ``We turned around. None of us had enough money to foot 
            the bill.'' </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> In 1961, the Cuban Hebrew Circle was 
            founded. Now called Temple Beth Shmuel, Cuban Hebrew Congregation, 
            it is at 1701 Lenox Ave., Miami Beach. In the 1960s and 1970s, there 
            were about 900 families in the congregation. Now there are only about 
            650 as many families move away from Miami Beach, which had been where 
            most Cuban Jews used to live. </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> <b>TEMPLE MENORAH </b></font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> One existing synagogue that welcomed 
            Cuban Jews right from the start was Temple Menorah in Miami Beach. 
            Rabbi Meyer Abramowitz, who was the spiritual leader at the time, 
            offered the refugees free synagogue memberships until they could become 
            settled in their new home. Today, Cuban Jews are among the mainstays 
            of the synagogue. The president, Rosita Zelcer, is a Cuban Jew. </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> The current rabbi, Eliot Pearlson, 
            feels very close ties to the community. </font><font face="Arial" size="-1">``I 
            understand why, contrary to other immigrants, the Cuban Jewish community 
            has maintained the language, the music and the cuisine of their country 
            of birth,'' he said. </font><font face="Arial" size="-1">``My father 
            arrived from Poland at the age of 17 and the first thing he did was 
            change his name and forget the Polish language. The Poles were anti-Semitic, 
            their interaction with the Jewish community was negative and all he 
            wanted to do was to forget that part of his life. </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> ``In Cuba, however, from what I understand 
            there was very little anti-Semitism and therefore Jews wanted to preserve 
            the positive aspects of that culture. The tolerant environment of 
            Cuba, in fact, enabled Jews to maintain a positive Jewish identity. 
            It is no surprise that the Cuban Jewish community has now reached 
            the highest levels of leadership in Miami.'' </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Many Cuban Jews have prospered beyond 
            their dreams in Miami. But for many, their change of status has not 
            brought a change of attitude. </font><font face="Arial" size="-1">Rafael 
            Kravec is founder and CEO of French Fragrances, a publicly traded 
            company. In 1960, he came penniless to Miami when the wholesaler he 
            worked for in Havana was taken over by the government. ``For the first 
            eight months, I sold flowers for an importer, worked at Burdine's 
            and even joined a trade mission to the Caribbean as a translator,'' 
            he recalled. </font><font face="Arial" size="-1">He said that even 
            though he loves this country and has prospered here he still does 
            not fell 100 percent American. ``I'm still a Cuban and have very strong 
            ties with Israel,'' he said. ``I live Cuba and Israel every day.'' 
            </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Some were affected by Castro's takeover 
            at a very early age. Marcos Kerbel emigrated to Miami at the age of 
            12 as part of the Pedro Pan airlift. He lived in foster homes in California 
            until his parents could join him in Miami years later. </font><font face="Arial" size="-1">He 
            spent 22 years heading the Miami office of the Israel Discount Bank 
            and believes that he enjoys the best of three worlds, being Cuban, 
            American and Jewish. Kerbel said that at midnight every New Year's 
            Eve at the annual party at the Cuban Hebrew Congregation, everyone 
            sings three national anthems -- from Cuba, Israel and the United States. 
            </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> According to Jaime Suchlicki, a Cuban 
            Jew who is a professor of Cuban history at the University of Miami, 
            most Cuban Jews are apolitical and have not gotten involved in Cuban 
            exile politics. The one notable exception was Benes, who during the 
            1970s was extremely active. At one point during the Carter administration, 
            he was among a group of Cuban exiles who took part in a dialogue with 
            Fidel Castro. The talks resulted in the freedom of many Cuban political 
            prisoners. However, Benes was vilified by many Cuban exiles for negotiating 
            with Castro and he largely withdrew from exile politics. </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> <b>TRANSITION </b></font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Suchlicki, who is the author of a widely 
            used history of Cuba, said that ``Cuban Jews are a generation in transition 
            with a diluted identity. We identify with three countries: Cuba, the 
            U.S. and Israel.'' He said Cuban Jews have very little political clout 
            in Miami, but some economic clout. A number of Cuban Jews also have 
            become prominent in the organized Jewish community here. ``Four years 
            ago, we inaugurated Isaac Zelcer as the first Cuban president of the 
            Greater Miami Jewish Federation,'' he said. Zelcer is another local 
            success story. In 1960, he left Cuba with his young family and went 
            to New York, where he worked in a tie factory until he became president. 
            In 1980, he moved to Miami and started Isaco Ties, which is now one 
            of the largest accessories companies in the U.S. </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> The Zelcers were so dedicated to business 
            that when the family would travel to Lake Como in Italy to develop 
            the line, the children, rather than going to the beach, would visit 
            the mills with their parents. ``That's how they learned the business,'' 
            Zelcer said. </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> George Feldenkreis came to Miami in 
            1961 ``with a pregnant wife, a child in my arms and $700 in my pocket. 
            Today as CEO of Supreme International, Feldenkreis is at the helm 
            of one of the major sportswear manufacturing firms in the country, 
            with the recent acquisition of Perry Ellis International. </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> <b>ACTIVE </b></font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Feldenkreis has long been active in 
            the Jewish community, from working for the Zionist Union in Havana 
            to serving as president of the Cuban Division of the Greater Miami 
            Jewish Federation. He said that some day, when he has the time, he 
            would like to be president of the federation. </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> A number of members of the Cuban Jewish 
            community have been major charitable givers. Among the most prominent 
            is Isaac Olemberg. The ballrooms of both the Cuban Hebrew Congregation 
            and Temple Menorah bear his name. </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Most Cuban Jews are of the European 
            tradition, and both of these synagogues are Ashkenazi. The principal 
            Sephardic Cuban synagogue is Torat Moshe, 1200 Normandy Dr., Miami 
            Beach. At Torat Moshe, the Orthodox tradition is observed and women 
            and men sit separately. </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Sabeto Garzi is president of Torat 
            Moshe, where Sephardic Week is observed every February with a cultural 
            and musical program including performances in Ladino, the Sephardic 
            counterpart to Yiddish. Salomon Garazi is also past president of FESELA 
            (The Sephardic Federation of Latin America). </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> He and Alberto Barrocas, who is active 
            in the Latin Auxiliary of the Miami Jewish Home for the Aged, are 
            among the most prominent and involved people in the Sephardic Cuban 
            community here. The Sephardic and Ashkenazi communities are somewhat 
            less polarized in Miami than they had been in Cuba, where both had 
            their own community centers. </font> <font face="arial" size="-1"><br>
