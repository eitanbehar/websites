              <p><font face="Arial">What happens if you break the law?</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">It is illegal for Americans to visit Cuba 
                as tourists. Yet few people who do so wind up in trouble.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">Last year, President Clinton signed the Helms-Burton 
                Act, which raises the potential penalties on Americans who go 
                to Cuba as tourists to $250,000 in criminal fines and $55,000 
                in civil fines. The Treasury Department has brought 10 criminal 
                indictments for violations related to travel to Cuba in the past 
                15 years, and the possibility of civil fines is small but real. 
                Penalties of $1,500 to $2,000 have been assessed in 44 civil cases 
                since 1994.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">Students, academics, missionaries, and travelers 
                whose expenses are paid by a person not subject to U.S. jurisdiction 
                are among those who can seek special Treasury Department approval 
                for entering Cuba. For those in such categories, Marazul Tours 
                (800-223-5334) can make hotel and airline reservations. If you 
                don't qualify but decide to buck the sanctions anyway, travel 
                agencies in Toronto, Cancun, and Nassau will book you on a tour.
