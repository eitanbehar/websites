              <b>(A Cuban Revival, Part 3)</b> 
              <h3 align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">By Kenneth Bandler</font></h3>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">HAVANA (JTA) -- Strolling 
                on Paseo Prado, one of the Cuban capital's main boulevards, Rabbi 
                Shmuel Szteinhendler,with eyes open wide and a broad smile, stops 
                a group of schoolchildren and charms them into singing. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">The 20 children, all 
                strangers to the rabbi, are gleeful. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Their young teacher 
                steps forward and selects one to recite a poem. As soon as she 
                finishes, Szteinhendler lifts the young girl, gives her a loving 
                hug and a kiss on the cheek, and thanks all the children gathered. 
                </font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Once again, the charismatic 
                Argentine-born rabbi has touched some individuals in a meaningful 
                way. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">``Being a rabbi has 
                to be a kind of vocation -- a passion -- a mission,'' says Szteinhendler, 
                49. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">His mission, he says, 
                is ``to give a meaning to being in this world.'' </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Touching individual 
                lives, especially Jewish souls, is his special mission. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">For the Jews of Cuba, 
                Szteinhendler's periodic visits during the past four years have 
                been central to the renaissance of their community. He has helped 
                fill a void created more than three decades ago when all the rabbis 
                fled Cuba after the 1959 revolution. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">``Rabbi Szteinhendler 
                is our spiritual father,'' says Yosef Levy, president of the Sephardic 
                Jewish Center here. ``We only see him two or three times a year, 
                but he is always in our minds.'' </font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Szteinhendler began 
                his communal career at the age of 15 in Buenos Aires, where he 
                later was ordained as a Conservative rabbi. For the past 18 years, 
                he led a congregation in Guadalajara, Mexico. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">About 20 percent of 
                that congregation came from Cuba when thousands of Jews fled Fidel 
                Castro's revolution. He says his congregants led him to believe 
                that there were no Jews left in Cuba,except for a few elderly 
                ones. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">But, in January 1992, 
                Szteinhendler made his first visit here at the behest of the American 
                Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, which had entered Cuba a 
                year before to provide community-development expertise in reinvigorating 
                a long-dormant Jewish community. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">``I remember they told 
                me, `Don't forget us,' because other rabbis had come and gone,'' 
                Szteinhendler recalls of the Jews he met then. When he returned 
                two months later with religious supplies, ``they were shocked 
                that I returned.'' </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Szteinhendler's inspirational 
                appeal to this community now totaling some 2,000 people quickly 
                became apparent when he accompanied a JDC board mission to Cuba 
                in early December. The trip coincided with the 40th anniversary 
                of the Patronato, the main synagogue here. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Szteinhendler was continually 
                praised by Cuban Jews, both old and young, for his work with their 
                community. At times he could be seen fighting back the tears of 
                joy that come from knowing deep inside that in Cuba he has clearly 
                fulfilled his mission in life. </font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">``When you perform 
                a mitzvah for someone, it is not so important that the person 
                thank you,'' Szteinhendler says. ``You must thank the person who 
                allowed you to perform the mitzvah -- and then you really feel 
                alive.'' </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Szteinhendler, who 
                recently moved to Santiago, Chile, to head a congregation, is 
                not alone in bringing to Cuba the vitality of the Argentine Jewish 
                community, the largest in Latin America. </font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">The JDC program in 
                Cuba was initiated in 1991 by Alberto Senderey, an Argentine who 
                now heads the JDC office in Paris. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Jorge Dinier, who just 
                completed two years here as director of the JDC program in Cuba, 
                also is from Buenos Aires. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Along the way, they 
                have brought in Argentine teachers and rabbis to help with the 
                rejuvenation of the Cuban Jewish community. Dinier's successor 
                is yet another Argentine, Roberto Sanderowitsch. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Szteinhendler's exuberance 
                about his experience with Cuban Jewry stems from the knowledge 
                that here he finds ``people who are in real need and in worse 
                condition'' than where he comes from and works. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">``Here they are fighting 
                for higher values,'' he says. <br>
