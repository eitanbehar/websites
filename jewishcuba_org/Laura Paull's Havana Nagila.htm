      called "the Jews that time forgot" - the cousins who left Poland or 
      Russia, Turkey or Yemen in the early 1900s, stopped in Cuba, and never 
      made it to New York.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have been 
      dubbed "Castro's Jews" in recent articles from the American press - those 
      who for whatever reason didn't leave Cuba when they 
      could.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are "the world's last 
      bastion of Jewish socialism," according to one Cuban historian, a 
      description that some among Havana's Jewish community - as politically 
      varied as Jewish communities anywhere else in the world - would no doubt 
      dispute.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They themselves say that they 
      have been better treated in Cuba than anywhere else in the world to which 
      their family history extends.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, 
      like all Cubans, they say they are 
      hungry.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who are these people? What are 
      they doing there? How are they surviving, individually and collectively? 
      As Americans and members of the larger Diaspora, do we have a historical 
      responsibility towards them? What transformations have they undergone in 
      their move from the harsh climate of Europe to the tolerant warmth of the 
      Caribbean? What are their values and how are they manifested in a Latin 
      American, socialist society? What are their views on Jewish identity, 
      Israel, and U.S.-Cuban relations? Perhaps most importantly, what can they 
      tell us about Cuba?</I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=4><B>Havana Nagila</B> is a 57-minute video documentary that 
      traces the history and presence of the Jewish community in Cuba. It 
      explores the impact of the 1959 Revolution, what it has been like for the 
      five percent of the original community that has lived through these three 
      and a half decades under Castro, the phenomenon of the community's recent 
      resurgence, and the international issues that affect its future. Rich in 
      archival material and Cuban ambiance, with interviews that present a side 
      of Cuba never seen before, the film reveals some forgotten Jewish history 
      and examines aspects of Cuban politics and culture through the experiences 
      of Jews in both pre-and post-Revolutionary Cuba. It notes some of the 
      contributions of Jews to Cuba as a nation, and explores the persistence of 
      Jewish values - both secular and religious - in the lives of these people, 
      particularly under the current political and economic difficulties. The 
      film also documents the impact of the U.S. trade embargo and Soviet 
      collapse. Finally, it allows the Cuban Jews to make their own case for the 
      strengthening of the existing historical and cultural ties between Cubans 
      and Americans. For Jews and all others whose families share the experience 
      of immigration, it will be clear that the people portrayed in this film 
      are Cubans by chance as much as by choice, and that, "there but for 
      fortune," any one of us might have found ourselves in their place today. 
      <I>Havana Nagila</I> will leave audiences inspired by the Jews of Cuba - 
      and challenged by them.</FONT></P>
