                        might have been called "the Jews that time forgot" - the 
                        cousins who left Poland or Russia, Turkey or Yemen in 
                        the early 1900s, stopped in Cuba, and never made it to 
                        New York.<br>

                        They have been dubbed "Castro's Jews" in recent articles 
                        from the American press - those who for whatever reason 
                        didn't leave Cuba when they could.<br>

                        They are "the world's last bastion of Jewish socialism," 
                        according to one Cuban historian, a description that some 
                        among Havana's Jewish community - as politically varied 
                        as Jewish communities anywhere else in the world - would 
                        no doubt dispute.<br>

                        They themselves say that they have been better treated

                        family history extends.<br>

                        they surviving, individually and collectively? As Americans 
                        and members of the larger Diaspora, do we have a historical 
                        responsibility towards them? What transformations have 
                        they undergone in their move from the harsh climate of 
                        Europe to the tolerant warmth of the Caribbean? What are 
                        their values and how are they manifested in a Latin American, 
                        socialist society? What are their views on Jewish identity, 
                        Israel, and U.S.-Cuban relations? Perhaps most importantly, 
                        what can they tell us about Cuba?</font></i></font></p>

                        Nagila</b> is a 57-minute video documentary that traces 
                        the history and presence of the Jewish community in Cuba. 
                        It explores the impact of the 1959 Revolution, what it 
                        has been like for the five percent of the original community 
                        that has lived through these three and a half decades 
                        under Castro, the phenomenon of the community's recent 
                        resurgence, and the international issues that affect its 
                        future. Rich in archival material and Cuban ambiance, 
                        with interviews that present a side of Cuba never seen 
                        before, the film reveals some forgotten Jewish history 
                        and examines aspects of Cuban politics and culture through 
                        the experiences of Jews in both pre-and post-Revolutionary 
                        Cuba. It notes some of the contributions of Jews to Cuba 
                        as a nation, and explores the persistence of Jewish values 
                        - both secular and religious - in the lives of these people, 
                        particularly under the current political and economic 
                        difficulties. The film also documents the impact of the 
                        U.S. trade embargo and Soviet collapse. Finally, it allows 
                        the Cuban Jews to make their own case for the strengthening 
                        of the existing historical and cultural ties between Cubans 
                        and Americans. For Jews and all others whose families 
                        share the experience of immigration, it will be clear 
                        that the people portrayed in this film are Cubans by chance 
                        as much as by choice, and that, "there but for fortune," 
                        any one of us might have found ourselves in their place 
                        today. <i>Havana Nagila</i> will leave audiences inspired 
                        by the Jews of Cuba - and challenged by them.</font></p>
