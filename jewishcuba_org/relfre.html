              <h2>Professor: Cubans Free To Worship</h2>

                (AP)- After long years of severe repression, the Cuban government 
                now imposes no restrictions on freedom of worship, and religious 
                freedoms have been broadened, a Cuban professor said Wednesday.</p>
              <p>``One can't really speak of religious persecution in Cuba today,'' 
                said Enrique Lopez Oliva, a professor at the University of Havana, 
                who is on a tour of several U.S. cities to talk about the impact 
                of Pope John Paul II's visit to Cuba in January.</p>
              <p>Lopez Oliva, who co-edits an independent magazine, noted that 
                during Holy Week in April, religious pilgrimages appeared in Cuba 
                once again, ``without any difficulty or barrier.'' He added that 
                he teaches at a Bible study group that attracts about 300 students 
                each Saturday.</p>
              <p>It is highly unusual for a Cuban who is not a spokesman for the 
                government to talk about the situation on the island in a public 
                session in the United States. Lopez Oliva said his request for 
                permission to visit the United States was approved quickly by 
                Cuban authorities. His Capitol Hill appearance Wednesday was sponsored 
                by the Washington Office on Latin America, which monitors political 
                and human rights issues in the hemisphere.</p>
              <p>During the early days of the revolution, the Roman Catholic Church 
                was seen as an enemy of the revolution, and several hundred priests 
                were expelled. Cuba was officially atheist until 1992, when it 
                became a secular state. Bars to Communist Party membership for 
                religious believers were dropped.</p>
              <p>The State Department's latest annual human rights report, published 
                in January, said Cuba had eased the ``harsher aspects'' of religious 
                repression but still imposed limits on access to the media and 
                continued to ban the establishment of religious schools.</p>
              <p>The report was completed before the pope's Jan. 21-25 visit to 
                Cuba.</p>
              <p>Over the years, Lopez Oliva had sought greater space for the 
                church in Cuba. During the 1980s, he published a newsletter on 
                religion in Cuba that was eventually suppressed by the regime.</p>
              <p>He said Cuba has a number of independent religious publications, 
                and they are not subject to prior censorship.</p>
              <p>``I am co-editor of a magazine, and nobody reviews me before 
                I get published,'' he said.</p>
              <p>He acknowledged that one of the dangers the church faces is that 
                it might be seen as a stalking horse for the counterrevolution.</p>
              <p>To combat this perception, he said the church has to be seen 
                as a ``respectable interlocutor - in other words, that it won't 
                stab (President) Fidel (Castro) in the back.''</p>
              <p>He added that the church must be seen as a possible ally of the 
                regime as it copes with the transition brought about by the breakup 
                of the Soviet bloc and attempts to deal with the new reality.</p>
              <p>``Nonetheless, it cannot be denied that, although the church 
                carries out a pastoral mission, its activities transcend the narrow 
                religious framework and encompasses a political framework with 
                respect to the national and social well-being,'' he said.</p>
