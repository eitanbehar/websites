  <p> <font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    <strong><a name="1"></a>RECENT CONTAINERS SENT TO CUBA</strong></font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We&#8217;re very happy with the 
    work we&#8217;ve been able to do recently, but at <br>
    the moment all of that is overwhelmed by the work we need to do as a <br>
    result of hurricane Dennis.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> But still, it&#8217;s worth recounting 
    some recent successes.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> First, we are VERY EXCITED about 
    our recent partnership with <br>
    WORKING BIKES COOP of Chicago. We recently went out there to learn how they 
    <br>
    operate and they are wonderful</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It works like this. Working Bikes 
    goes to the scrap yard in Chicago <br>
    where metal is collected and melted down every day. &#8216;Junqueros&#8217; 
    (mostly <br>
    Latino) drive up in trucks with all kinds of metal trash, and the <br>
    Working Bikes guys flag down any truck with a bicycle on it, and buy the <br>
    bicycle for a few dollars. All of these bicycles are repaired, and some of 
    <br>
    them are sold inexpensively, which provides the money to ship the other <br>
    bicycles all over the world.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Thanks to our relationship with 
    Working Bikes, and with the Baracoa/ <br>
    St. Augustine Friendship Association, we have sent about a thousand <br>
    bicycles to Cuba, primarily to handicapped people who can ride bicycles, <br>
    and to hospital workers- from doctors to cooks to the people who clean <br>
    the floors. Everyone who works in a Cuban hospital is doing heroic duty, <br>
    and deserves a small reward.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And now we have convinced Working 
    Bikes to collect wheelchairs as <br>
    well as Bicycles! We have send about 500 wheelchairs, and we are still <br>
    collecting about 10 a week. </font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Specifically, in the last three 
    months we have sent two containers of <br>
    bicycles and wheelchairs to Oriente-Guantanamo, Santiago de Cuba, <br>
    Baracoa, and Yateras (in Guantanamo Province.) Another container is on the 
    <br>
    way.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thanks to our partnerships with 
    the One World Foundation, we are <br>
    sending an additional container, mostly disposable surgical supplies, to <br>
    Santiago de Cuba. Thanks to our partnership with the Madison Medical <br>
    Project, we are helping to send a container of medicine and supplies to <br>
    Camaguey.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We are well on our way to meeting 
    our goal of 12 containers sent <br>
    this year.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a name="2"></a>HURRICANE 
    RELIEF</strong></font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Hurricane Dennis has struck Cuba 
    very, very hard.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We are working with our existing 
    partners, and some new partners, to <br>
    send additional containers of Hurricane relief to Cuba. In addition to <br>
    the always needed medicine and surgical supplies, we are going to send <br>
    household items such as mattresses, cooking pots, disinfectant, <br>
    detergent, just about anything, because everything is needed by the tens of 
    <br>
    thousands of people who lost everything they had. JUST TODAY WE LOADED A <br>
    40 FOOT CONTAINER IN MADISON AND CHICAGO WITH MATTRESSES, WHEELCHAIRS, <br>
    AND DISPOSABLE HOSPITAL SUPPLIES, DESTINATION GRANMA AND SANTIAGO. </font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although we are still 
    working out the details, it is likely that <br>
    distribution will be through ACLIFIM (association of the handicapped) and 
    the <br>
    Jewish Synagogue in Santiago de Cuba, working through the very small <br>
    Jewish communities in Campechuela and Manzanillo. Our Jewish friends in Cuba 
    <br>
    are a reliable and appropriate NGO who will help supervise the massive work 
    that we are <br>
    going to initiate, and help us distribute the materials to the entire community.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In order to document this emergency 
    hurricane relief, we have created a <br>
    new web page at www.cubacaribe.com . We will list every donation <br>
    (unless a donor wants to be anonymous) not only of money but also every <br>
    bottle of aspirin, every pot and pan, and we will document the distribution 
    <br>
    of everything as well. Our intention is to be 100% transparent in <br>
    everything we do. ALL money donated for hurricane relief will go towards <br>
    shipping supplies- NO money will go towards salary, administrative <br>
    expenses, phone bills- NOTHING. And we will document that.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AND HERE IS SOME GREAT NEWS- WE 
    JUST RECEIVED A MATCHING CHALLENGE <br>
    DONATION FROM A GOOD FRIEND IN CALIFORNIA- ALL DONATIONS UP TO A TOTAL OF 
    <br>
    $1,250 RECEIVED IN THE NEXT 10 DAYS WILL BE MATCHED.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> If you want to help, we have set 
    up a Paypal account to make this as <br>
    easy as possible. It costs about $25 to send a wheelchair to a kid who <br>
    right now cannot get across the room. For $100 we can put a few <br>
    families back on their feet. You can make the difference with your donation. 
    <br>
    Please help.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    <strong><a name="3"></a>SMALL CONFERENCE FOR CUBA RELATED HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS</strong></font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We always like to partner with 
    other organizations. There are so many <br>
    good people who want to do good work. Therefore our friends at the <br>
    Vermont Institute on Cuba are sponsoring a small conference for sister <br>
    organizations, October 1-2 in Burlington Vermont. This is a WORKING GROUP 
    <br>
    for organizations that want to learn more about the Commerce license, <br>
    OFAC travel license, resolving problems in the USA and in Cuba. Invitees <br>
    include the Cuba Aids Project, the St. Augustine Baracoa Friendship <br>
    Association, The Wisconsin Medical Project, The Cuba--America Jewish <br>
    Mission, the One World Foundation, Infomed, the Dubois Family Foundation, 
    <br>
    Marazul Travel, and many others.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> If you know organizations that 
    have a Commerce/and or OFAC license, <br>
    are currently engaged in humanitarian work in Cuba, or are interested in <br>
    doing this work, please let them know of this opportunity to share and <br>
    learn to do more.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a name="4"></a>TRAVEL 
    TO CUBA</strong></font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CMT can authorize professional 
    and technical specialists who wish to <br>
    travel to Cuba on a full time schedule of activities directly incident to 
    <br>
    sending more containers under our Commerce license. We can send people <br>
    in groups, or in some cases, we can send qualified individuals <br>
    traveling on their own.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In additional to the &#8216;ordinary&#8217; 
    trips to send &#8216;ordinary&#8217; supplies, <br>
    we are going to lead a few trips specifically designed to help us send <br>
    more emergency hurricane relief. Please write if you would like to know <br>
    if you are qualified to participate in these trips.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a name="5"></a>WHAT 
    YOU CAN DO TO HELP</strong></font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> If you know other groups who might 
    want to post this notice- please <br>
    go right ahead!<br>
    If you know individuals who would like to receive these newsletters- <br>
    go to our web page www.cubacaribe.com and sign them up! Our mailing <br>
    list is now about 1,850, but we know there are thousands more people who <br>
    would like to hear from us.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> If you have access to humanitarian 
    supplies- please write!<br>
    If you have an old computer, or camera, or some other electronic <br>
    item that you are not using- let us find someone in Cuba who needs it more 
    <br>
    than you.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fund-raisers, funders- we&#8217;ll 
    take your call!<br>
    <br>
    Mostly it comes down to two things</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1) Spread the word!<br>
    2) Send money</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It costs about $4,000 to send 
    20,000 pounds of supplies. Compared to <br>
    the costs of bringing these supplies box by box, paying overweight <br>
    charges- That&#8217;s cheap!<br>
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> For some reason, major disasters 
    like hurricanes help all of us to <br>
    step back a little from the politics, and join the heroes, here and <br>
    there, that are giving everything they have to solve real human problems.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Please join these heroes.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thank you!</font></p>
