              <p><font color="#000044"><b> After years of shaping Cuba as an atheist 
                state, Fidel Castro has started to make some room for religion 
                on the island. The question now: Just how much room will he give 
                it? "Are you priests? Confessors? Those are my intimate affairs 
                and I don’t accept that you have me make that kind of public confession," 
                he responded to reporters who asked if he believes in God. He 
                refused to say if he believes in God &#0151; be it the God of 
                Christianity or that of the Afro-Cuban religion known as Santeria. 
                "Are you priests? Confessors?" Castro replied when foreign reporters 
                asked him that a week before the pope&#0146;s visit. "Those are 
                my intimate affairs and I don&#0146;t accept that you have me 
                make that kind of public confession. </b></font>
              <p> <font color="#000044"><b>"I can say one thing," Castro added. 
                "I respect those who believe and those who do not believe. If 
                you say you do not believe, you offend those who believe. If you 
                say you believe, you offend those who do not believe. In a way 
                you make yourself a preacher. I am not a preacher." </b></font>
              <p><font color="#000044"><b> So, instead of preaching, he has sent 
                signals &#0151; over several years now &#0151; that he&#0146;s 
                willing to make some room for religion in Cuba. </b></font>

              <p> <b><font face="Times New Roman,Times" size=3 color="#FF0000">HOW? 
                A LIFE WITH RELIGION</font> </b>
              <p> 
              1932-&#0146;45: Jesuit schools Castro spent more time with Catholic 
              priests in his youth than most people do in a lifetime. The son 
              of a Spanish peasant turned wealthy landowner, Castro went to religious 
              boarding schools, first with Marist brothers from age 6-9 and then 
              two Jesuit schools until age 18. 
              <p><b> Castro is the first to admit he wasn&#0146;t a model student, 
                and even boasts of how he pummelled a Marist priest once. </b>
              <p><b> And he has told interviewers that priests were never able 
                to engrain a religious faith in him. Yet he has also praised the 
                Jesuit system for its &#0147;spirit of discipline&#0148; and for 
                having &#0147;formed people of character. </b>
              <p><b> Indeed, it turns out that many of Fidel&#0146;s fellow rebels 
                were educated by Jesuits in cities around Cuba. His recollections 
                of those years can be contradictory. He has noted his fascination 
                with the Bible and its parables but also claimed he &#0147;lost 
                many years&#0148; to &#0147;superstitions and lies.&#0148; </b>
              <p><b> And while he claims those school years helped him hone his 
                political skills, he never pursued a cause even though the Cuba 
                of those years was a cauldron of instability. His focus, he has 
                told interviewers, was on sports and good grades. </b>
              <p> <b><font face="Times New Roman,Times" size=3 color="#FF0000">1945-&#0146;50: 
                COLLEGE YEARS</font> </b>
              <p><b> Imagine a college campus where students wore guns because 
                of killings between rival political parties. That was Havana University 
                as lived by Castro, who until then had led the disciplined student 
                life of the Jesuits. </b>
              <p><b> That environment also required one to take political sides. 
                Initially, and ironically, Castro&#0146;s first foray was with 
                a Catholic student faction &#0151; against the Communists. At 
                that time Castro and Communist leaders had a mutual mistrust. 
                He later maneuvered between parties before settling into a nationalist, 
                anti-U.S. stance. </b>

                THE REVOLUTION</font> </b>
              <p><b> Castro graduated in 1950, and by 1953 had begun an armed 
                uprising, attacking the Moncada military barracks. It was only 
                then that the church reappeared in Castro&#0146;s life. Here&#0146;s 
                a quick rundown of events where Castro and religion have mixed 
                since then. </b>
              <p><b> 1953: Bishop Enrique Perez Serantes, a Castro family friend, 
                helps spare Fidel and his brother Raul from the death penalty 
                for attacking the Moncada barracks. </b>
              <p> <b>1957: Several priests join the rebel army as chaplains. </b>
              <p> <b>1959: Victorious Castro marches into Havana wearing a chain 
                around his neck showing Cuba&#0146;s patron saint, the Virgin

                "Meet the Press" back in February 1959 (10 minutes) National Catholic 
                Congress gathers tens of thousands in the Plaza of the Revolution; 
                Castro attends. Speakers praise Castro&#0146;s overthrow of Fulgencio 
                Batista dictatorship but criticize communism, class struggle and 
                atheism. </b>
              <p> <b>1960: Pastoral letter by Cuban bishops praises the idea of 
                social reforms but warns against communism. </b>
              <p> <b>1961: Three priests are among the Bay of Pigs invaders captured 
                by Cuba. Militia occupy a number of churches and briefly imprison 
                leaders suspected of favoring the invasion. Castro announces that 
                the revolution is socialist, later elaborates that it is Marxist-Leninist. 
                A large march organized by the church is broken up by police. 
                More than 100 priests are expelled; 460 others leave on their 
                own within the first three years of revolution. All private and 
                religious schools are closed, except for seminaries. Catholic 
                Church unveils &#0147;Operation Peter Pan,&#0148; encouraging 
                parents to send their children abroad for schooling. </b>
              <p><b> 1962: Fidel Castro reveals details of the government's education 
                program in a 1962 TV broadcast to the nation. <font color="#770000">Constitution 
                modified to make Cuba an atheist state, an action that bans religious 
                Cubans from many jobs.</font> </b>
              <p><b> (The following note is added by correspondent Roberto Solera:) 
                </b>
              The MSNBC version is mistaken. The Constitution was never revised 
              in 1962 to say that Cuba had an atheist government. The 1940 Constitution 
              was reformed and changed into Ley Fundamental in 1959 (they just 
              amended some articles). We had to wait till 1976 for the Constitution 
              to be reformed. In that one that affirmation was made.

                transformed into Technical Schools or into Techical Institutes 
                (examples of the former, Maristas in Rancho Boyeros Highway and 
                of the latter Colegio Belen, first made "Hnos Gomez" Institute
