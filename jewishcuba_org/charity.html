              A small statue of the Virgin Mary is revered in Cuba as Our Lady 
              of Charity, a symbol of faith and national identity. 
              <p><b> Our Lady of Charity has been entwined with the island's history 
                for nearly 400 years, ever since the statue was found floating 
                in the Bay of Nipe off the island's northeast coast.</b>
              <p><b> The discovery is chronicled in an account set down decades

              <p><b> Between 1606 and 1612, two Indian brothers -- Juan and Rodrigo 
                de Hoyos -- set out with the 10-year-old African slave Juan Moreno 
                to collect sea salt for the Spanish colony's booming copper-mining 
                settlement of El Cobre. Crossing the bay in a small craft, the 
                three spied an object -- ``a white thing floating on the foam.''</b>
              <p><b> When they drew near, they found it was a statue of the Virgin 
                Mary, about a foot high, carrying the infant Jesus on her left 
                arm and a gold crucifix in her right hand. The statue was attached 
                to a plank inscribed: `Yo soy la Virgen de la Caridad [I am the 
                Virgin of Charity].''</b>
              <p><b> They carried the statue to El Cobre, where it became an object 
                of veneration whose image spread throughout the island, often 
                shown rising above a stormy sea before the gaze of three awestruck 
                voyagers in a tiny boat.</b>
              <p><b> Our Lady of Charity was declared Cuba's patron saint by Pope 
                Benedict XV in 1916. The saint's day is celebrated Sept. 8.</b>
              <p><b> Known familiarly as Cachita, Our Lady of Charity is special 
                not only to Cuba's Roman Catholics but to followers of Santeria, 
                who worship her as the Yoruba goddess Ochun.</b>
