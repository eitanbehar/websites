                <h2>Cuba</h2>
                <h2>History</h2>
              </center>
             
                <p>During the Spanish colonial rule that lasted until 1898, very 
                  few Jews lived in Cuba, and nearly all of them were apostates 
                  or Jews from the Dutch Antilles, holding Dutch nationality. 
                  Jose Marti, the liberator of Cuba, enjoyed the support of the 
                  Jews of Jamaica, Texas and Florida, and American Jewish veterans 
                  of the Spanish American War settled in Cuba. In 1904 they founded 
                  a congregation. These Jews were later joined by Sephardim from 
                  Turkey who founded their own synagogue. </p>
                <p>Cuba was a popular transit point for East European immigrants 
                  awaiting admission to the United States. Some of these Jews 
                  remained in Cuba. In the 1930's a central Jewish committee was 
                  created to represent all Jewish groups. The plight of the Havana-bound 
                  passengers stranded on the German liner St. Louis dramatized 
                  the tragedy of Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany, yet they 
                  were also denied admission to Cuba. In 1952 there were more 
                  than 12,000 Jews in Cuba; 75% lived in Havana and the rest in 
                  the rural provinces. At that time Ashkenazim accounted for some 
                  three-quarters of the community. </p>
                <p>Cuban Jews participated in an active communal life and they 
                  published a number of newspapers in Yiddish and Spanish with 
                  diverse religious and political orientations. Although the Cuban 
                  revolution was not directed against Jews, it destroyed the economic 
                  stability of Cuban Jewry which was primarily middle class. The 
                  great majority of Cuban Jews, together with many of their non-Jewish 
                  countrymen, found sanctuary in Miami, Florida. Most of the remaining 
                  Jews in Cuba live in Havana. </p>
                <h3>Communal and Religious Life</h3>
                <p>The Casa de la Communidad Hebrea de Cuba is the Jewish communal 
                  organization. Four synagogues, two Sephardi and two Ashkenazi, 
                  continue to function. The Patronato Synagogue also maintains 
                  a kosher kitchen. The Jewish school closed in 1975, but the 
                  community maintains a Sunday school. Kosher food and ritual 
                  items are imported, primarily from Canada.The synagogue in Santiago 
                  de Cuba was rededicated in 1995 to serve 80 Jews in that city. 
                </p>
                <h3>Israel</h3>
                <p>Communist Cuba maintained normal relations with Israel until 
                  1973, when it joined the Third World in severing diplomatic 
                  ties. Since 1948, 661 Cuban Jews have immigrated to Israel.
