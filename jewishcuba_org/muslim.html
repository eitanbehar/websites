              </p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">A South African Cuban solidarity 
                brigade, the Alex La Guma Brigade - named after the South African 
                writer who died in exile in Cuba, recently went to pay homage 
                to La Guma and, as a solidarity brigade, to learn about the lives 
                and struggles of the Cuban people under a US-imposed embargo.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> The 38 South Africans spent one 
                month in Cuba visiting different areas, attending lectures and 
                working in the fields - picking nectarines and oranges. Integrated 
                into this rather hectic schedule Fatemah's mission - which others 
                from the group were unsuspectingly drawn into - was to find a 
                Muslim in this &quot;atheist&quot; state whose official &quot;religion&quot; 
                was communism.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Cuban tourist brochures inform 
                the visitor there is &quot;thorough freedom of religious practices. 
                Most believers are Catholics. A number of churches are spread 
                over the country, religious services are conducted every day: 
                masses, baptisms, weddings, requiems and confessions. Afro-Cuban 
                religions (a merging of African pantheons and Catholic Saints) 
                are deeply rooted.&quot;</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Nothing is mentioned of the world's 
                other religions, including Islam.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Led by Fatemah, the search was on. 
                Everybody in Cuba knows the Catholic Saint, the Lady Fatima. This 
                put our Fatemah under some strain to explain on numerous occasions 
                and in broken, hastily learnt Spanish: &quot;Me llamo Fatemah. 
                Soy Muslim. Si Islam. No Catholica!&quot;&quot;I am Fatemah, I 
                am Muslim, not the Catholic one.&quot;</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Whether by accident or design, 
                on one Friday, the day of Jumu'ah, we found ourselves at a mosque! 
                The House of Arabs in Old Havana (La Havana Vieja) which serves 
                as a souk (market) is piled high with carpets, robes and pottery 
                - and a place of worship for Muslims.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> The curator of the building gave 
                us a briefing on the origins of the building, which was built 
                in the 17th century. Like most of the buildings in Old Havana 
                this one is constructed in Mudejar style - a Christian/Muslim 
                architectural tradition that evolved in Spain. Because of these 
                architectural wonders UNESCO declared old Havana a world heritage 
                site in 1982, and a number of buildings are in the process of 
                being renovated. The curator told us the mosque was used by foreign 
                diplomats and foreigners working in Cuba.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Muslim yes, but still no Cuban 
                Muslims! Fatemah persisted. &quot;What about indigenous Cuban 
                Muslims?&quot; she asked. The curator replied that they numbered 
                not more than 20. Fatemah pushed him to provide her with an address 
                of one. &quot;Lo Siento!&quot; (I am sorry), he said. &quot;We 
                do not keep such a list!&quot; Perhaps to cheer us up he added 
                that over 400 Muslim names, like Abdella and Mansur, existed in 
                Cuban society. These names, we discovered have their roots in 
                the period of slavery.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Enjoying the beauty of the architecture, 
                we had missed Jumu'ah prayers but decided not to let this opportunity 
                pass. Led again by Fatemah, a few Brigadistas prepared to pray 
                their Zuhr, possibly the first South Africans to perform salah 
                in this mosque. No Cuban Muslims, but the group was obviously 
                satisfied with its efforts.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Only a fool will believe that official 
                approaches to religion will not change. We say this with the knowledge 
                that Fidel Castro (a Jesuit-educated lawyer and now President 
                of Cuba) had a highly-acclaimed meeting with the Pope John Paul 
                III recently. The Pope is scheduled to visit Cuba this year.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> During his five-day visit to the 
                Vatican Castro told Vatican Radio, &quot;We want to create a climate 
                of trust and good relations with the Church.&quot; And in a communiqu&#130;, 
                the Cuban Catholic Church archbishop, Jaime Ortega, exhort the 
                leaders of nations &quot;whose historical, economic or humanitarian 
                interests link them to Cuba to look for the solution to existing 
                conflicts in dialogue.&quot; He also urged Cuban Catholics to 
                work in a united way for the future, by preserving the nation's 
                dignity and freedom.&quot;</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Meanwhile, we are back home and 
                reflecting on our experiences, satisfied in the knowledge that 
                the struggle for national independence, social, economic and political 
                justice is not incompatible with genuine religious practices and 
                freedoms and religion does not need the state to survive.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">We saw and we learnt. And we know 
                there is no need to conquer.</font></p>
