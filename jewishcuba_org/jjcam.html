              <blockquote> 
                <p> <font face="Arial" size="-1">&quot;You’re going to where?&quot; 
                  <img src="jjpho.jpg" width="116" height="142" align=RIGHT> That 
                  was the usual reaction to our announcement that Michelle and 
                  I were going to Cuba. </font></p>
                <font face="Arial" size="-1">It hadn’t always been the plan. When 
                we realised that Mike and Linda Necus would be celebrating their 
                silver wedding anniversary exactly a week after us, the four of 
                us had thought about throwing a big joint simcha but, after a 
                meal together to discuss plans, we came up with a much better 
                idea- a joint holiday. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Why Cuba? Well, because it was 
                  a special occasion we wanted somewhere exciting, preferably 
                  hot any sunny which wasn’t too expensive. Cuba fitted the bill 
                  exactly. The company called the trip "The Cuba Experience," 
                  which it certainly was. We soon got used to the inevitable cracks 
                  about hi-jacking and beards and began to find out what we could 
                  about Cuba. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">We hadn’t realised that there 
                  were any Jews on the island but researches on the Internet led 
                  me to a couple of sites including one <a href="http://jewishcuba.org">The 
                  Jews of Cuba</a>. This is an American site which contains a 
                  considerable amount of information. It is run by Richard Smith 
                  of Richmond, Virginia, and Jorge Rivero Behar, of Santiago de 
                  Cuba.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Although organised religion was 
                  largely outlawed following the 1959 revolution, the government’s 
                  stance began to relax during the late 1980’s until in 1992 organised 
                  religion was once again permitted. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Although most of Cuba’s Jews left 
                  the island for the United States there are still about 2,000 
                  Jews on the island. Most of these, about 1400, live in Havana, 
                  where there are three Shuls, but we were particularly interested 
                  in the community of Camaguey, which is in the centre of the 
                  country and is Cuba’s third largest city, as for most of our 
                  trip we would be in Playa St. Lucia which is about 70 miles, 
                  or one and a half hours’ drive from Camaguey. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">The Jews of Camaguey are in the 
                  process of building a new Shul, the first to be built in Cuba 
                  since the revolution. It has a Jewish population of about 140, 
                  which makes it about the same size as Northampton. After finding 
                  an article on the Internet about the community by David Abel 
                  we decided to try to contact the community. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">This was easier said than done. 
                  After contacting Richard Smith by e-mail, he put me in touch 
                  with Mindy-Sue Shapiro who has been to Camaguey and has met 
                  some members of the community. She gave us the address and telephone 
                  number of Alberto and Miriam Roffe, who are the leaders of the 
                  community. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Our holiday comprised two nights 
                  in Havana, 10 nights in Playa St. Lucia and the last night in 
                  Havana before flying home overnight. It isn’t generally known 
                  but Cuba is a very big country. It’s over 800 miles long and 
                  our transfer from Havana to Playa St. Lucia would be by internal 
                  flight. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">What we hadn’t bargained for was, 
                  first, the amount of time you waste in transfers on a two centre 
                  (or in our case a three centre) holiday and second, Hurricane 
                  Mitch. After a full day in Havana we set off for the airport 
                  the following afternoon for what was supposed to be a short 
                  (1½ hour) flight to Camaguey, arriving at the airport two hours 
                  before the flight was due to leave. We arrived during what we 
                  thought was a short-term tropical rainstorm but was actually, 
                  unknown to us, the start of Hurricane Mitch. Our flight was 
                  in an old but reliable Russian Antonov propeller engined plane. 
                  Because the plane only flies at about 10,000 feet it isn’t pressurised. 
                  The cooling system involves opening vents allowing cool air 
                  into the cabin or, when you’re flying through cloud, steam. 
                  This looks frighteningly like smoke! </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">About 10 minutes before we were 
                  due to land we learnt that owing to adverse weather conditions 
                  (i.e. another tropical storm) at Camaguey, we were to be diverted 
                  to Holguin which is half an hour further on. After an hour in 
                  a transit lounge at Holguin we flew back to Camaguey. We arrived 
                  at about 7.30 and after a seemingly endless coach trip through 
                  the rain we arrived at St. Lucia at about 9.00 in the evening. 
                  For the next two days we had intermittent rain and strong winds. 
                  We were actually very lucky because we were only on the fringe 
                  of the area affected by Mitch. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">I telephoned Alberto Roffe in 
                  Camaguey and arranged to go to his house a couple of days later. 
                  This was quite a phone call considering that I don’t speak any 
                  Spanish and he has virtually no English! Our tour representative, 
                  Ariel, comes from Camaguey and kindly marked the street on our 
                  map for us. We hired a car and drove to Camaguey. Driving in 
                  Cuba is a dream during the day- there’s virtually no traffic 
                  outside the cities. At night it’s a different story with dozens 
                  of cycles being ridden along unlit streets without lights, not 
                  to mention horses and carts! </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">After looking around Camaguey 
                  for the morning aided by a charming boy of about 14 who attached 
                  himself to us as an unofficial guide, we set off to find Alberto’s 
                  house using our rep’s instructions. We ended up quite lost but 
                  a kindly museum curator led us on his bike all the across to 
                  the other side of the city where the address really was. Thanks, 
                  Ariel! </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">We eventually arrived at the house 
                  in the late afternoon and were made very welcome by Miriam who 
                  speaks very little English. We were soon joined by Alberto and 
                  another member of the community and also by a lady who’s an 
                  English teacher. With her help, we had a very interesting conversation. 
                  We also met Miriam’s mother who lives next door. Unfortunately 
                  there was then a power cut. This happens virtually every day 
                  in much of Cuba. Miriam showed us some photographs including 
                  a recent one of her and Alberto under a chupa during a ceremony 
                  when she converted to Judaism. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">While we were at the house, someone 
                  brought in what looked like half a loaf of French bread. This, 
                  she told us, is a day’s bread ration for two people. When we 
                  thought of the mountains of food we’d eaten in the hotel and 
                  of the amount that’s thrown away, we felt very guilty. </font></p>
                <font face="Arial" size="-1"><img src="jjcam.jpg" width="214" height="268" align=LEFT> 
                </font> 
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Alberto then took us to see the 
                  new Shul which is about 10 minutes’ walk away. It’s a very small 
                  building which seems to be two houses knocked into one. The 
                  structure is sound but there’s a great deal to do inside. Alberto 
                  told me that they had hoped to open the Shul in time for Rosh 
                  Hashanah but that they had run out of money and had to stop. 
                  The Shul has one Sefer Torah and a small Ark. They hope to open 
                  it for prayer some time next year but this depends on donations. 
                  When you consider that a doctor in Cuba earns about 20 dollars 
                  a month (no it’s not a misprint) they need all the help they 
                  can get. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Alberto is very proud of what 
                  they have achieved. The community is growing. they have 27 children 
                  so far. The community is dependant on help both from inside 
                  Cuba and from outside. They receive supplies from America and 
                  help from a Rabbi from Havana. They are starting to learn Hebrew. 
                  After all they have 40 years to catch up. </font></p>
