              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> WILLEMSTAD, Curacao 
                (Apr 5, 1996 5:30 p.m. EST) -- The year was 1492.</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> It was the eve of 
                Christopher Columbus' Aug. 2 voyage to the New World and the Spanish 
                port was engulfed in panic by Jews desperate to flee Spain.</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> One of Columbus' Jewish 
                crew members was hurriedly converted before the voyage left.</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Those still in Spain 
                at dawn faced a choice: convert to Christianity or face a slow 
                torturous death at the hands of the Holy Inquisition. When the 
                sun rose, not a single self-professed Jew remained on Spanish 
                soil.</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> The many who refused 
                to convert embarked on a worldwide search for religious freedom 
                frustrated in the New World by centuries of laws forbidding those 
                of Jewish ancestry to enter Spanish colonies.</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> For these Jews, known 
                as Sephardics, Curacao and other Dutch colonies in the Americas 
                were more than simply a port in a storm. They were the key that 
                unlocked a closed door to the Americas.</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Today, the islands 
                that once served as a precious haven are scrambling to hang on 
                to their Jewish heritage, just as American Sephardic -- whose 
                largest colony of 110,000 is in South Florida -- are struggling 
                to pass on their language and traditions to the next generation.</font> 
              <p align="left"> <font face="Arial" size="-1">"Jews from Curacao 
                not only kept the flame alive, they contributed to the spread 
                of Jews throughout America," said Rene Maduro, 54, the scion of 
                one of an old, prosperous Jewish family that owns banks and businesses 
                in Curacao. He is acting rabbi of its synagogue. "We are preserving 
                the cradle of Judaism in the Americas. This was the mother congregation 
                of the Western hemisphere."</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Time has not been 
                kind to the Curacao Jews' historic 17th century Bet Hayim cemetery, 
                one of the oldest European burial grounds in the hemisphere. Its 
                gravestones' elaborate carvings are slowly being eaten away by 
                fumes from the smokestacks of a nearby oil refinery on the outskirts 
                of Willemstad.</font> 
              <p align="left"> <font face="Arial" size="-1">"It's beyond repair. 
                There is nothing to be done," Maduro said, shaking his head.</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> The Jewish community 
                on the island has shrunk to less than 500 as youngsters go away 
                to college in the United States and don't come back.</font> 
              <p align="left"> <font face="Arial" size="-1">"The numbers are dwindling. 
                Families are much smaller," said Charles Gomes Casseres, 75, a 
                leading historian for the Jewish community and a member of its 
                Council of Elders. "If you become too few you can hardly maintain 
                the institutions. It becomes much harder to survive."</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> What can never be 
                erased, however, is the legacy these families left.</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Over the centuries, 
                wealthy Jewish shipping families from Curacao have donated millions 
                of dollars to build synagogues, schools and Jewish communities 
                from South America to Charleston, Rhode Island, Philadelphia and 
                New Amsterdam, now New York.</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> The Nephutsay Israel 
                synagogue in Newport still says an annual prayer for the Curacao 
                Jews in commemoration of their help building a house of worship 
                in 1763.</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> That is why for many 
                here, the Mikve Israel-Emmanuel synagogue of Curacao, a tiny cactus-covered 
                island ringed by kaleidoscopic reefs and some of the most beautiful 
                beaches in the Caribbean, is a symbol for a tradition that spans 
                the hemisphere.</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Built in 1732, the 
                arching yellow Dutch building is the oldest synagogue in continuous 
                use in the Americas. Its congregation dates back nearly a century 
                more.</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> The sand on the floor 
                of Mikve and the other old Caribbean synagogues is said to recall 
                Moses' flight out of Egypt. It also recalls the need to muffle 
                the sound of the feet of Jews meeting secretly under the Inquisition 
                in Spain.</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> The synagogue on windswept 
                Curacao is a lingering reminder of winds of tolerance that have 
                blown throughout the history of the Caribbean, where centuries 
                of multinational rivalries for tiny but lucrative islands left 
                behind a modern patchwork of colors, creeds and cultures whose 
                modern coexistence provides a striking contrast to an intolerant 
                world.</font> 
              <p align="left"> <font face="Arial" size="-1">"The Caribbean has 
                been a haven for Jews," Mark Kurlansky wrote in his book on the 
                region, "A Continent of Islands." "Caribbeans are accustomed to 
                diversity and, like other forms of racism, anti-Semitism appears 
                here only in subtle forms."</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> The Curacao Jews left 
                their mark in the Dutch West Indies, turning Willemstad into a 
                major hemispheric shipping center and even influencing the eventual 
                lingua franca of the Dutch West Indies.</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> The Jews, who had 
                spent several generations in Portugal, were the first Europeans 
                to adopt Papiamento, the language created by African slaves from 
                the tongues of Portuguese slavers, Dutch traders and West African 
                tribesmen. Like Haitian Creole, Papiamento may soon gain recognition 
                as the native language of the Dutch West Indies.</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Jews reached Curacao 
                via Holland, which opened its doors to Sephardics after their 
                80-year war with Spain and welcomed Jewish settlers in the deserted, 
                cactus-studded West Indian islands Holland wished to control.</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> The first Jewish settler, 
                Samuel Coheno, reached Curacao in 1634, just after Dutch forces 
                wrest the island from Spain, on an expedition of the Dutch West 
                Indies company.</font> 
              <p align="left"> <font face="Arial" size="-1">"The Dutch, of all 
                the European countries, have been extremely good to the Jews. 
                They've remained extremely tolerant and much more accommodating 
                than other European countries," said David Siman, president of 
                the Sephardi Association of Palm Beach County in Florida.</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> International jousting 
                with the Spanish Armada slowly turned the tide of European anti-Semitism, 
                opening the way for enemies or victims of the Catholics in Protestant 
                countries.</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Anti-Catholic Oliver 
                Cromwell followed Holland's example and reopened England to Judaism 
                in the late 1600s.</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Denmark also hosted 
                Jewish congregations who moved north from Holland and Germany 
                but restricted them and other foreign religious refugees to two 
                cities until the late 1700s. After that they were free to move 
                on to Danish West Indies colonies, like St. Thomas.</font> 
              <p align="left"> <font face="Arial" size="-1">"This ethnic cleansing 
                was going on in Europe," Maduro said. "But after the 1600s these 
                northern countries began to look at Jews in a different way. They 
                began to bring them back in for economic development."</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> At the time Spain, 
                attempting to enforce Catholic hegemony after driving Moorish 
                conquerors out of southern Spain in 1492, required immigrants 
                to Cuba and other New World colonies to prove "cleanliness of 
                blood" by demonstrating no ancestors of Jewish or Moorish blood 
                for four generations.</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> The Dutch-Jewish bond 
                has lingered in the Caribbean.</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Another member of 
                the Maduro family, George, a son of one of Curacao's wealthiest 
                families, was studying law at the University of Leiden when the 
                Nazis invaded Holland. He became a lieutenant in the Dutch cavalry, 
                was taken prison and died at the Dachau concentration camp.</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> In the 1960s, Dutch 
                diplomats helped arrange a Dutch commercial flight from Curacao 
                to spirit Jews out of Cuba, where a crackdown against religion 
                was under way. Many of them still reside in South Florida today.</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Like most forms of 
                xenophobic intolerance, the demonization of non-Christians exacted 
                a high price from Spain.</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> While most of Europe 
                was being transformed by the Reformation, the Enlightenment and 
                the Renaissance, Spain's counter-reformation turned it into a 
                backwater deprived of the intellectual currents that nourished 
                advances in theology, philosophy and the arts sweeping through 
                the rest of Europe.</font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"> While European history 
                moved forward, Spain -- and many of its colonies in Latin America 
                -- was held back for hundreds of years.</font> 
              <p align="left"> <font face="Arial" size="-1">"The measures against 
                secret Jewry led to a profound intolerance which prevented the 
                emergence of a real Spanish Renaissance," wrote Hugh Thomas, the 
                distinguished biographer, in "The Conquest."</font>
