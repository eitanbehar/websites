                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> What will Pope John Paul II find 
                  during his visit to Cuba? It is well known that religion has 
                  been severely repressed by Castro, but what has been the nature 
                  of said repression and what is its current status? What can 
                  be expected as a result of the pope's visit? Over two decades 
                  of experiential study of Cuban social reality allow us to explore 
                  this issue. Let us make a brief historical overview.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> More than persecution in the 
                  traditional sense, religion has been seriously repressed through 
                  various direct and indirect means. All religious groups have 
                  been seriously affected. The Catholics, as the largest religious 
                  group in Cuba, have been the most severely impacted in terms 
                  of material losses, while the Jehovah's Witnesses have been 
                  the most directly repressed. All their temples were shut down.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> In 1960, after initially supporting 
                  the revolution, the Catholic Church valiantly confronted the 
                  Castro regime. Indicators of a new dictatorial trend were visible, 
                  though shrouded by populist policies. Among these signs were 
                  the arbitrary executions and trials that started in 1959, the 
                  government's shrewd takeover of student, labor and professional 
                  organizations, along with the increased placement of communists 
                  or their sympathizers in government and military positions, 
                  the progressive confiscation of private property and, finally, 
                  the complete elimination of the free press. The Church alerted 
                  the people about the evils that would come from the turn towards 
                  Communism. The strong pastoral letter of August 1960 only increased 
                  the regime's antireligious actions. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Many believers, following the 
                  Church's teachings, decided to confront the regime. They fought 
                  justly and bravely, trying to the implement of the ideals of 
                  democracy promised by Castro in the Sierra Maestra. Many paid 
                  with their lives or long years in prison for this "crime."</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> In response to this confrontation, 
                  Castro launched a campaign against the Catholic bishops and 
                  attempted to create a national Church. By late 1960, mobs organized 
                  by the government began to harass church services. The botched 
                  Bay of Pigs invasion led to a more open and direct repression, 
                  with mass arrests of clergy and desecration of churches. In 
                  May, 1961, the government confiscated the vast private school 
                  system and many seminaries in an attempt to deeply strike at 
                  religion. In September, the traditional procession in Havana 
                  honoring Cuba's patron, the Virgen de la Caridad, in the church 
                  of the same name, was violently repressed, resulting in the 
                  death of one of the Catholics. Incredibly, the government portrayed 
                  the victim as a martyr of the revolution... That incident prompted 
                  the immediate expulsion of 131 clergy onboard the Spanish ship 
                  Covadonga, including an outstanding bishop, Boza Masvidal and 
                  Father Goberna, a renown hurricane expert.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Direct repression had its climax 
                  at this time. Many religious personnel were forced into exile 
                  through coercion, intimidation or the inability to practice 
                  their teaching trade. Four priests were sentenced to prison 
                  for serving as chaplains to the opposition's guerrillas. To 
                  further hurt the Church, a dynamic young Franciscan priest, 
                  Miguel Loredo, was, in 1966, falsely accused and sentenced to 
                  fifteen years in prison, --the same amount of time Castro received 
                  in 1953 after leading the assault on the Moncada barracks-- 
                  for harboring a suspect in a failed skyjacking attempt. He served 
                  ten of those fifteen years... This opportunity further served 
                  to confiscate the Church's only printing shop as well as the 
                  San Francisco convent. Many Evangelical ministers were also 
                  imprisoned, some for long periods. It must be pointed out that 
                  these actions were always undertaken under a nonreligious pretext, 
                  as in the Loredo case. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> In this context, many ministers 
                  and seminarians, Catholic and Evangelicals were sent to the 
                  newly created UMAP labor concentration camps in 1965. Among 
                  those confined were the present cardinal Jaime Ortega and the 
                  current bishop Alfredo Petit, along with many lay people. Among 
                  these in the UMAP were homosexuals and others the regime considered 
                  "social scum." The Jehovah's Witnesses were especially mistreated 
                  at the UMAP's, which closed in 1968. The purpose was to terrorize 
                  the religious community.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> The 1960's also saw the dawn 
                  of a more subtle, but very effective, indirect repression. This 
                  less visible form of repression used education and the workplace 
                  as its main vehicles. It begun as early as grammar school with 
                  simple questions posed to school children practicing their faith, 
                  in an attempt to ridicule them in front of their classmates. 
                  Students have a Cumulative Academic Record that supervises "ideological 
                  integration" and the religious involvement of students and their 
                  parents. This involvement would constitute a "demerit" on their 
                  record and would be used to deny access to the university or 
                  to careers with social impact to those who had that blotch in 
                  their record. This indirect repression followed Castro's religious 
                  policy of "making apostates not martyrs," and thus began the 
                  slow process of gradually attempting to choke off the religious 
                  community. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Indirect repression also impacted 
                  the individual through the work place. The government's economic 
                  monopoly, whereby the state owns all means of production promoted 
                  discrimination against those who practiced religion. "Being 
                  religious" constituted a stain on the worker's Labor Record 
                  preventing occupational advancement, and affecting the person's 
                  standard of living, since the government use to distribute important 
                  consumer goods through the work place where "ideological integration" 
                  played a role. As with education, the "religious" were forced 
                  give up opportunities for promotion, becoming second class citizens. 
                  This has been, in actual practice, an ideological apartheid.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Religious ministers have also 
                  suffered strong repression. Defamatory letters, instigation 
                  of rumors, and constant spying are routinely employed with special 
                  cases. Harassing phone calls and blackmail, mostly through sexual 
                  entrapments, are used to psychologically destabilize them and 
                  promote their departure from Cuba. Foreign clergy have also 
                  been repressed. Some have been openly expelled from Cuba, while 
                  others have had their visa renewal rejected as was the recent 
                  case involving Sister Ligia Palacio, a Colombian nun who dared 
                  to write "too harshly" concerning human rights in Cuba in Vitral, 
                  a modest (only over 1000 copies are made by photocopy procedure) 
                  but outstanding publication of the Pinar del Rio diocese. Other 
                  foreigners have suffered an equal fate.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> After his release from prison 
                  in 1976, Fr. Loredo continued to be a persona non grata. He, 
                  along with many of his parishioners were constantly harassed. 
                  This culminated in a mysterious, near fatal car accident in 
                  which he was a pedestrian. The Church finally promoted his "voluntary" 
                  exit from the island in 1984. A rather similar case occurred 
                  in 1995, when small-town priest Fr. Jose Conrado Rodriguez wrote 
                  a letter which courageously but respectfully criticized Castro 
                  and his regime. This increasingly popular priest had to leave 
                  the country in 1996 "to conduct studies abroad." </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> The government has also used 
                  its complete control over the entry of foreign religious personnel, 
                  as well as its control over equipment and materials for religious 
                  activities, as a form of subtle repression. The clergy has also 
                  been victim to repeated attacks through Cuban television and 
                  movies. Catechism classes have also been the target of harassment 
                  in many ways, particularly through the so called "street plans" 
                  (planes de la calle) designed to interrupt the attendance of 
                  children. Meanwhile their parents have been intimidated in other 
                  forms. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Another repressive method has 
                  been the sabotage of religious holidays like Holy Week. The 
                  government has forced it to coincide with the Victory at Giron 
                  Beach celebration in April (accompanied with mobilizations of 
                  workers), to prevent attendance at these religious services. 
                  Furthermore, Christmas was taken away from the Cuban people 
                  when Castro ordered its cancellation in 1969 to prevent work 
                  shortages in an attempt to reach the failed 10 million ton sugar 
                  harvest of 1970. This is unprecedented in the Western world, 
                  where even former communist Eastern Europe observed this Christian 
                  tradition. It appears that it was restored as a holiday for 
                  1997 as a conciliatory gesture toward the pope after the discovery 
                  of an electronic bug in a room His Holiness will use in his 
                  upcoming visit. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Evangelicals have been especially 
                  repressed, since the government considers them officially associations 
                  and not religious denominations, and thus are subjected to greater 
                  scrutiny. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Religious organizations has been 
                  denied access to the mass media since 1960. But it is noteworthy 
                  that the government has been, in a subtle way, constantly promoting 
                  the sincretism between the Afro and Catholic beliefs called 
                  Santería, which lacks a strong moral code, and is more pliable 
                  to the effort for control. Santeria has been portrayed in the 
                  media, which is fully all in governmental hands, as Cuba's majority 
                  religion, in an effort to undermine the traditional Christian 
                  denominations. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> By the end of the 1980's, and 
                  after the publication of the book Fidel Castro and Religion 
                  (Fidel Castro y la Religion), with Frei Beto, where Castro projected 
                  a rather sympathetic view of religion, there was a relaxation 
                  ofrepression for reasons of tactical convenience. People began 
                  to attend religious services in greater numbers. Educational 
                  as well as labor discrimination for reasons of religious practice 
                  have diminished. However, the Cumulative Academic and Labor 
                  Records still exist and totalitarian power can demolish any 
                  religious effort or individual considered potentially "dangerous." 
                  </font>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> The 1989 demise of the USSR contributed 
                  to the growth in religious participation, especially among the 
                  youth. Castro agreed in 1992 to let believers participate in 
                  Cuba's Communist Party. Paradoxically, the opposite has happened. 
                  Many young people are looking to fill their spiritual void andlive 
                  another reality of true human solidarity within the religious 
                  lay communities. In these groups, a true sense of fraternity 
                  and desire to serve others is apparent.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Also noteworthy is the work displayed 
                  by Caritas, the Catholic charities organization, which has tried 
                  to mitigate the growing material needs endured by the people 
                  with international help and obligatory payment in dollars. Caritas 
                  has donated large amounts of medicine to government centers 
                  and has been buying powdered milk and other food products at 
                  wholesale prices at the dollar stores that now sell to anyone 
                  having that currency (the "Shopping" as they are popularly called 
                  by the people) to be distributed freely, mostly among the elderly. 
                  This sector of society is the most affected by the huge inflation 
                  generated by the government which only sells certain vital goods 
                  only in stores using that currency (a bottle of cooking oil, 
                  practically available here only, costs about half the average 
                  monthly salary). Upon realizing the positive effect of Caritas 
                  on the population, the government has undermined their effort 
                  by demanding that they buy at retail prices, thus making those 
                  purchases prohibitive.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> The religious rebirth in Cuba 
                  has had to face a great obstacle: the lack of churches. No new 
                  churches have been built since 1959, and many, particularly 
                  in the interior, have had their roofs fallen due to disrepair 
                  resulting from the absolute control of materials exercised by 
                  the government. On the other hand, the number of priests is 
                  about the same as in 1961, after the expulsions. The people 
                  have resorted to conducting religious services in private houses, 
                  mostly in the interior. The regime has curtailed this practice. 
                  Many have been closed. A very popular Pentecostal minister, 
                  Orson Vila, was went to prison in connection with this ministry. 
                  Indeed the distinction between freedom of worship (not entirely 
                  the case here) and freedom of religion (seriously curtailed 
                  due to the multiple controls) is very valid in Cuba today.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Religious centers that become 
                  particularly popular are harassed, and if possibly, eliminated. 
                  Such was the case of the Pentecostal Bible Institute at Cifuentes, 
                  in central Cuba, that was attracting many young people to special 
                  retreats. This institute was closed in 1995 through legalistic 
                  subterfuge. Outstanding lay leaders are also harassed. This 
                  has been the case of Catholic agricultural engineer Dagoberto 
                  Valdes from Pinar del Rio, who was professionally demoted and 
                  his family life disturbed. Another, Osvaldo Payá, had his house 
                  defaced and was forced to evacuate.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> News from Cuba suggests a governmental 
                  attempt to undermine the papal visit despite their claims otherwise. 
                  The international press has reflected this in connection with 
                  the curtailment of TV coverage, the availability of transportation 
                  (very little is in private hands), and the intimidation experienced 
                  by some attending preliminary religious events, like the open 
                  air Masses. Some believe that Castro is quite concerned about 
                  possible negative internal repercussions for his regime. Which 
                  leads us to predict that Castro will try to minimize the positive 
                  impact of the visit upon the people by undermining the effort 
                  in various subtle ways. Regardless, there is great expectation 
                  among the people. John Paul's visit could do a lot to advance 
                  the cause of human rights and the promotion of a true civil 
                  society. But we must be alert about harboring excessively high 
                  expectations for this visit in the short run, due to the sophisticated 
                  nature of the prevailing repression. Indeed, the pope will not 
                  find a Solidarity movement in present-day Cuba.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> In any event, it may be worthwhile 
                  to remind His Holiness that in comparative terms, Poland's Jaruzelski 
                  was an apprentice when measured against Castro's repressive 
                  experience. Religious repression has been stronger and more 
                  cunning in Cuba than in Poland and Cubans lack the religious 
                  militancy of the Poles. Nevertheless, this visit may provide 
                  a strong injection of faith, hope and valor... We must not forget 
                  that although the overt religious repression ofthe 1960's has 
                  abated, it continues to be "an iron fist in velvet glove" as 
                  expressed to me by a very knowledgeable person on religious 
                  matters who resides in Cuba.</font></p>
