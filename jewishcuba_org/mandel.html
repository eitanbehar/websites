              <p> 
              
                <p> Alejo Carpentier, a French-Cuban novelist, wrote a book entitled 
                  <i>Viaje a la Semilla</i>, in which the story's main character 
                  travels backwards through time, moving from adulthood to the 
                  seed from which he came. For several years I also had been trying 
                  to find a way to return to Cuba, where I was born in 1956. In 
                  1962, my family and I emigrated as refugees to the United States. 
                  Through the goodness of the HIAS and the Triester family, we 
                  found ourselves in Worcester, Massachusetts, surely no sister 
                  city to Havana and as foreign to my impressionable five year-old 
                  eyes as anything I had ever seen. After we settled, my mother 
                  insisted we speak only Spanish at home, for which I am grateful.

                          voyage back to my childhood--a childhood from which 
                          I had retained only some memories. But there are things 
                          about Cuba, its land, and its people, that are such 
                          an innate part of me that I instantly felt a sense of 
                          home upon seeing it for the first time in 35 years.

                <p><br>
                  In 1993, I entered the School of Sacred Music to begin my cantorial 
                  studies. While a first-year student in Israel, I began to read 
                  and hear information about the remaining Jewish community in 
                  Cuba, including articles written about rabbis from Mexico and 
                  Colombia who were traveling to Cuba to lend religious support. 
                </p>
                <p> After making inquiries at several organizations, I received 
                  an invitation from Warren Eisenberg, the Director of the Center 
                  for Public Policy at B'nai Brith International in Washington, 
                  D.C., to join a humanitarian mission to Cuba during the last 
                  week of January, 1997. The purpose of the mission was to bring 
                  badly-needed medical supplies to the Jewish community and to 
                  meet with the community's leaders. I was invited to provide 
                  religious and cultural support by leading <i>Shabbat</i> services 
                  at the Patronato Synagogue in Havana, meeting with the children 
                  of the religious school, and presenting two recitals of Jewish 
                  music--one in Havana, and one in Santiago de Cuba in Oriente 
                  province at the far eastern extreme of the island. </p>
                <p> Nothing could have prepared me sufficiently for the voyage 
                  back to my childhood--a childhood from which I had retained 
                  only some memories. But there are things about Cuba, its land, 
                  and its people, that are such an innate part of me that I instantly 
                  felt a sense of home upon seeing it for the first time in 35 
                  years. </p>
                <p> In the 1950's, before Castro came to power, there were almost 
                  20,000 Jews in Cuba: a minority of Sephardic Jews, primarily 
                  of Turkish descent, who had been in Cuba for several hundred 
                  years, and a large number of Ashkenazic Jews who came from Eastern 
                  Europe (primarily Poland) mainly during the 1920's and 1930's. 
                  Today's Cuban-Jewish community consists of about 1,400 individuals, 
                  spread throughout the country. In the past few years, the Castro 
                  government has given the Jewish community increasing freedom 
                  to practice Judaism and has allowed 60 families to emigrate 
                  to Israel. There are about 390 Jewish families in Havana and 
                  four active synagogues: the Ashkenazic Conservative (the Patronato), 
                  the Sephardic Conservative, the Ashkenazic Orthodox, and the 
                  Sephardic Orthodox. Dr. Jose Miller, the head of Cuba's Jewish 
                  community, met our group in Havana. Our group of 31 hailed primarily 
                  from Dallas and Washington, D.C., and included Tommy Baer, the 
                  president of B'nai B'rith International, and Ruth Padorr, a 
                  Cuban native from Chicago who sang with me during recitals. 
                  Together, we visited all of the synagogues, met with the members 
                  of the communities, prayed <i>Shacharit</i> in the Ashkenazic 
                  Orthodox synagogue and prayed together for Friday evening <i>Shabbat</i> 
                  services at the Patronato. </p>
                <p> Upon entering the lobby of the Patronato synagogue--where, 
                  long ago, members of my family were married and where I served 
                  as ring boy 36 years earlier--I noticed an inscription of my 
                  great uncle's name, Israel Ticochinsky, as one of the founders 
                  of the synagogue. Dr. Miller saw me notice this and told me 
                  that I had a second cousin, Yolanda, who still lived in Cuba 
                  and came to services every week. He put me in contact with her 
                  and we spent an amazing day together recreating my family's 
                  past. </p>
                <p> She took me to two places where I and my family once lived. 
                  The people living there now were charming, and invited us in 
                  for coffee. I actually remembered the layout of the last place 
                  we lived in before leaving Cuba. My father's clothing store 
                  was now a cafeteria, my grandmother's apartment was a restaurant 
                  and the school I attended was divided up into several apartments. 
                </p>
                <p align="left"> Ruth Padorr and I performed in Santiago and gave 
                  another concert in the Patronato synagogue, accompanied by the 
                  pianist from the Havana Lyric Opera company. The services were 
                  memorable for several reasons: it was the first time I had prayed 
                  in Spanish (to my recollection), and I was leading services 
                  in the synagogue that my great-uncle helped found. The synagogue's 
                  beautiful purple tinted windows, high above the ark, were almost 
                  all broken, and various animals and birds had taken up residence 
                  in the sanctuary. I was overcome by the strange beauty of seeing 
                  birds fly overhead during the service. </p>
                <p> Exactly one week after we arrived, we left Havana and returned 
                  to our respective cities in the U.S. But I felt I had <i>returned</i>. 
                  If not quite to the seed, then at least to the point where recollection 
                  is more physical than verbal; to a place where, for better or 
                  for worse, I have attempted to recapture my feelings with words--words 
                  that can never be sufficient to explain what I felt. </p>
