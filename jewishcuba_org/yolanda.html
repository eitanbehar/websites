                introductory note: In developing this website I've received e-mail 
                from individuals around the country. This letter from "Yolanda" 
                sums up many of the concerns I've heard. It is presented here 
                unedited except for the paragraph separations. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#000099">Out 
                of respect for confidentiality, the correspondent's real name

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I had the opportunity 
                to browse the Web page of the Cuban Jews, and noticed that someone 
                is putting together a trip to Cuba in December. I have mixed feelings 
                about all this because they are helping Castro. As a Cuban I can 
                tell you that I'm against this sort of trip and that maybe because 
                the Jewish Federation has no "Russian Jews" to think about now, 
                the "forgotten Cuban Jews" have become their latest trendy Mizvak. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> If my memory does 
                not fail me, we the Cuban Jews that came in the early 60's were 
                primarily ignored by the rest of the American Jews. Our plight 
                and needs were many but the Federation for the most part ignored 
                us. One of the groups that lend us a hand was the Chabad house, 
                that's why some of the Cuban Jews ended up going to New York. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Chabad House by 
                the way has tripled their number in Miami with the help of the 
                Cuban Jews. The Jews that stayed in Cuba after 1970 were for the 
                most part Communists and were happy with Castro's regime. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I find the new discovery 
                in Cuba sort of offensive. My mother says that she knew of a few 
                families that were not able to leave the island because they were 
                not Cuban citizens & were not able to get here, she herself had 
                that problem, and it was only with the help of the Hasidic group 
                in New York that she was able to come in 1969, six years after 
                I came. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> You can see that I 
                have a lot of mixed feelings. I also have to wonder how come Fidel 
                has been so good to the Jewish Community even allowing Kosher 
                meat if it wasn't because of the money he is getting from us on 
                the side. At any rate, I'm sorry I got into this issue but my 
                Cuban part is also very strong, and I can't be one without the 
                other. </font></p>
