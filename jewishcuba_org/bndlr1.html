              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">HAVANA (JTA) -- When 
                Pablo Verbitzsky's father asked him to appear in a recent play 
                about Anne Frank, the university student eagerly joined the cast 
                of Cuban Jews. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Although he was not 
                familiar with the poignant Holocaust story, Verbitzsky, whose 
                mother is not Jewish, grew up with some sense of his Jewish heritage 
                from his father, an Argentine Jewish theater director who settled 
                in Cuba in 1961. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Now, after several 
                months of studying at the Patronato, the main synagogue here, 
                where there are no full-time rabbis, Verbitzsky is one of several 
                young Jews who regularly lead Shabbat services. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">The 18-year-old student 
                converted to Judaism in November. So did 49 other Cubans, all 
                children of interfaith couples in which the mother is not Jewish. 
                Under Jewish law, Jewish identity is passed matrilineally. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">``Everyone comes to 
                the synagogue to be together,'' says a beaming Verbitzsky, expressing 
                hope that ``the community will grow.'' </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Verbitzsky's story 
                is emblematic of the reawakening of Jewish life on this island 
                of 11 million people. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Located barely 90 miles 
                from the United States, Cuba has for more than three decades been 
                virtually cut off from the rest of the Jewish world. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Before the 1959 revolution 
                that brought Fidel Castro to power, Cuba boasted a vibrant Jewish 
                community of 15,000, with an array of Jewish institutions and 
                Zionist organizations. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">In the community's 
                heyday, there were five Jewish elementary schools, one Jewish 
                high school and five synagogues in the Cuban capital of Havana 
                -- the oldest a Sephardi synagogue dating from 1914. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Today, the Cuban Jewish 
                community -- numbering some 2,000 -- is a mix of Sephardi Jews 
                who came mainly from Turkey in the early part of this century 
                and Ashkenazi Jews who mostly arrived as refugees from Europe 
                before and during World War II. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Support for Castro 
                was nearly universal among the Jews when he overthrew the dictator 
                Fulgencio Batista. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">But within two years, 
                after Castro declared Cuba an atheistic state, nationalized businesses 
                and other properties, and introduced communism, some 12,000 Jews 
                joined thousands of other Cubans fleeing the country. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Most of the Jews landed 
                in southern Florida. Others went to Mexico and Venezuela. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">``Most Jews thought 
                they cannot raise their children as Jews,'' says Adela Dworin, 
                vice president of the Jewish community in Havana. ``They feared 
                civil war. Living only 90 miles from the United States, they believed 
                it was impossible for Cuba to survive without the help of the 
                U.S.'' </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Among the Jews who 
                fled were most of the community's leaders, all its rabbis and 
                teachers, and many who had lost businesses. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">In Miami, the continuing 
                hatred of Castro is just as strong among Jews from Cuba as it 
                is in the general exile community. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">``They believe that 
                any Jew who stayed in Cuba was a socialist or communist,'' says 
                Raquel Scheck, a Cuban Jew from Miami who recently visited Havana 
                for the first time since leaving in 1961. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">That view explains 
                why the remnant community in Cuba remains virtually cut off from 
                Cubans living in the United States. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">``Very few Cuban Jews 
                in Miami support Jews in Cuba,'' says Dr. Jose Miller, the longstanding 
                president of the Jewish community here. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">``Many of them do not 
                approve that other Jews are sending supplies [to Cuba] because 
                ultimately they say it will go to Castro.'' </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Among the Jews who 
                stayed, only a minority maintained any involvement with Judaism. 
                Most of the community drifted away from religious life, and intermarriage 
                was widespread. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">The Patronato could 
                barely muster a minyan, though a number of Jewish families continued 
                to observe Shabbat and major holidays in their own homes, even 
                though candles, bread and other supplies were scarce. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">For Passover, Jews 
                relied on packages sent from abroad, particularly from the Canadian 
                Jewish Congress, which had access because Canada maintained ties 
                with Cuba. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Still, Jews here could 
                get kosher meat, a fact many here point to as a sign of the absence 
                of anti-Semitism in Cuba. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">A visitor to Cuba today 
                finds a long-dormant Jewish community coming back to life with 
                vigor. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">The revival of Jewish 
                communal life stems in large part from a 1991 law passed by the 
                Cuban National Assembly that allows Cubans to be members of the 
                Communist Party and to participate in religious associations. 
                </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">``Without this, the 
                recovery of the Jewish community would not be possible,'' Miller 
                says. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">For more than 30 years, 
                the daily minyan usually consisted of seven elderly men and three 
                Torah scrolls placed in chairs in a small chapel, Miller says. 
                </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Today, 60 percent of 
                the 100 people who come regularly on Shabbat to the main sanctuary 
                are ``youngsters,'' he says. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">The ``youngsters have 
                a very strong Jewish feeling,'' Miller says. ``They have education. 
                Most important, they have Jewish soul.'' </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">When the American Jewish 
                Joint Distribution Committee began to work with the Cuban Jewish 
                community after the 1991 law was passed, the Patronato sanctuary 
                -- not used for more than three decades -- was in serious disrepair. 
                </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Today, after JDC representatives 
                led a clean-up effort, the large sanctuary is functional, though 
                the many rows of individual cushioned seats are well-worn and 
                numerous ceiling tiles are missing. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Because of broken windows, 
                a hat and sunglasses are in order during Shabbat morning services. 
                </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Still, the decorative 
                pulpit and the congregation's gold-trimmed china set, with dinner 
                plates bearing ``Patronato'' in gold lettering, are reminiscent 
                of a more glorious period in the history of this grand synagogue 
                that had barely passed its Bar Mitzvah year when the revolution 
                occurred. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">But for Alberto Senderey, 
                who initiated the JDC's Cuba program, the state of the building 
                is not the main concern. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">What is more important 
                is ``investing heavily in the people,'' says Senderey, an Argentine 
                who now heads the JDC office in Paris. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">During the past four 
                years, the JDC, which assists Jewish communities worldwide, has 
                brought in rabbis, teachers and youth leaders from Argentina to 
                help Cuban Jews rebuild their community. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">In December, an exuberant 
                Jewish community celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Patronato. 
                Leaders of smaller communities across the island -- Camaguey, 
                Cienfuegos and Santiago de Cuba -- came to the capital for the 
                festivities. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Joining in the modest 
                celebrations were about 50 leaders of the JDC, constituting the 
                largest American Jewish group to visit Cuba in recent years. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Scheck of Miami grew 
                up actively involved with the Patronato. The decision to visit 
                here was ``very painful,'' she says, given the deep animosity 
                toward Castro. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">But ``I wanted to see 
                the community here, to see the youngsters,'' she says. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">The Patronato, which 
                remains the center of Jewish activity in the Cuban capital, is 
                indeed bustling. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">About 150 students 
                -- ranging in age from 4 to 60 -- attend Sunday school classes 
                that, because of a lack of space, are held in the sanctuary's 
                balcony. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">In the building's only 
                classroom, 12 young boys are training for their Bar Mitzvahs. 
                Organizations that meet regularly include local affiliates of 
                Hadassah and B'nai B'rith. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">In 1995, a communal 
                newsletter called Menorah was launched. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">All the teachers today 
                are Cuban, and some of them are university students who completed 
                a seven-month ``madrich,'' or leadership training, course here. 
                </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">At Havana's university, 
                there are about 100 Jewish students, says Liver Maya, 21, who 
                recently completed the leadership course. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Most of the 40 students 
                who participate regularly in programs became involved after a 
                core group went door-to-door, inviting them to youth-oriented 
                events, he says. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Olga Stolick, 21, says 
                even though both of her parents are Jewish and she grew up with 
                an awareness of her heritage, the madrich course taught her ``many 
                things about the Jewish people and Jewish life that are helpful.'' 
                </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Although older members 
                of the community are visibly delighted with the enthusiasm of 
                the younger members, a visitor detects that behind the smiles, 
                there is a sadness about the decades of inactivity. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">As a community ``we 
                were almost dead at the end of the 1980s,'' says Jewish community 
                head Miller. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">``The generation of 
                the 40- to 60-year-olds was the generation that left the community 
                when they were young, at the time of the revolution,'' says Jorge 
                Dinier, coordinator of the JDC programs in Cuba. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Havana Jewish community 
                Vice President Dworin says, ``We are the lost generation. We lost 
                our youth.'' </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Dworin, a university 
                student at the time of the revolution, decided in 1960 not to 
                leave Cuba. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">``I was born here, 
                and I felt this was the country that opened its doors to my family 
                from Russia and Poland, and I felt I must have loyalty,'' she 
                says. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">``My father was afraid 
                to leave the country without me because when he left Pinsk, he 
                never saw his brother'' and many other relatives who perished 
                in the Holocaust, she says. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">As a result, Dworin's 
                family stayed, and were among the few Jews who remained active 
                with the Patronato. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Most of Dworin's contemporaries 
                either left Cuba or simply lost touch with the community. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Rabbi Shmuel Szteinhendler, 
                an Argentine who on periodic visits to Cuba in the past four years 
                has helped spark the Jewish revival, credits the dramatic growth 
                of ``Jews coming out'' simply to ``word of mouth.'' </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">The community has nearly 
                tripled in size from the 700 Jews the JDC officials found here 
                in 1991. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Part of the growth 
                came from the outreach to Jewish communities in smaller cities, 
                but much of it was due to children of interfaith couples deciding 
                to convert. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">As a result, 60 percent 
                of the community's 2000 Jews are converts, says Szteinhendler, 
                who was brought to Cuba by the JDC. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">In addition to the 
                50 conversions carried out in late November, 30 circumcisions 
                and 20 weddings were performed by two Argentine rabbis and an 
                Argentine mohel. The three traveled by bus to three cities, carrying 
                with them for the marriage ceremonies the only ``chupah,'' or 
                wedding canopy, the Patronato owns. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">All conversions are 
                done in strict accordance with Jewish law, says Szteinhendler,
