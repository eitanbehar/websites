                "Hotel Cuba," an original videotape<br>
                </font></b><font size="+1" color="#000040">by Robert M. Levine</font></p>
              <p><font color="#000040"> During the early 1980s, I met a young 
                rabbi, Jeffrey K. Salkin, who had come to Miami as an assistant 
                at Temple Israel. One day he told me that he had met in Miami 
                Beach with a group of Cuban-Jewish teenagers, whom, he had been 
                told, were undergoing identity problems, because the local Cubans 
                rejected them because they were Jews and the local Jews rejected 
                them because they were Cuban. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#000040">I met with them several times and, as it 
                turned out, the story proved to be exaggerated. The kids were 
                doing just fine. But then I asked them about their parents and 
                grandparents--most of whom had come to Cuba in the 1920s or earlier 
                from Eastern Europe, Turkey, or Morocco--they replied that they 
                know almost nothing about their experiences on their adopted tropical 
                island only 90 miles from Florida's shores. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#000040">Intrigued by their ignorance of their family's 
                past, I asked them if they would like to help interview members 
                of the Cuban- Jewish community in South Florida. I subsequently 
                recruited other volunteers to start an oral history project about 
                Cuba's Jewish community before 1959. Working with a colleague 
                at Florida International University, Mark D. Szuchman, born in 
                Havana to Polish-Jewish parents and educated at Brandeis and the 
                University of Texas, Mark and I supervised an oral history project 
                that recorded more than 100 interviews. Our interest was not only 
                in the Jewish community itself, but the issues of acculturation 
                and assimilation against the background of Cuban history with 
                the Jewish community as a case study. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#000040">Mark and I are both scholars, and we know 
                that community history usually comes up short unless it is analyzed 
                in the broader historical context. For this reason, we interviewed 
                non-Jewish Cubans also, including a former WWII-era Minister of 
                Justice. Some people in the local Cuban- Jewish community did 
                not like this, but we interviewed them anyway. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#000040">I personally extended the research to New 
                York (using the files of HIAS, the AJC, and the YIVO Institute), 
                Washington, D.C. (the National Archives and Library of Congress), 
                London (the Foreign Records Office), Israel, Venezuela, and California, 
                where a small group of Cuban Jews had settled. By this time I 
                had been asked by the historian David Wyman to write a chapter 
                on Cuba for his massive book The World Reacts to the Holocaust, 
                ultimately published by Johns Hopkins University Press in 1996. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font color="#000040">But first Mark and I decided to use the 
                interviews, as well as a collection of more than 3,000 slides 
                I had taken of scenes from mostly inter-war Cuba. I also became 
                very interested in the story of the ill-fated S.S. St. Louis, 
                and travelled to Philadelphia to interview Rabbi Meyer Lasker, 
                who served the Reform congregation in Havana during the war years 
                and who acted as intermediary between the Jewish community, the 
                FBI, and the Cuban government on refugee matters. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#000040">Back in Miami,</font><font color="#000040"></font><font color="#000040"> 
                Mark and I applied for and received a $2,250 grant from the Florida 
                Endowment for the Humanities to make a videotaped documentary 
                from the interviews and research. Because we had so little money, 
                we could only interview on camera about a half-dozen persons, 
                and we could not afford a professional narrator. We had live public-domain 
                music performed for us by faculty and students from the University 
                of Miami School of Music because we could not pay for copyright 
                permission for recorded music. This was a documentary made on 
                a shoestring! </font></p>
              <p><font color="#000040">When we approached the local PBS station 
                to ask if the completed documentary might be aired, the request 
                was rejected even before we could send a copy of the video, on 
                the grounds that such a low-budget film could not be "broadcast-quality." 
                That the PBS people might have helped us upgrade it was never 
                considered by the officials to whom we spoke. Instead, the video 
                was accepted by WLRN, a public access cable channel owned by the 
                Dade County School Board. The good news is that on the day of 
                the broadcast, the Miami Herald ran a full-page story, so that 
                more people saw our video than any program in the history of WLRN. 
                The bad news was that it was aired at 10 pm, and the engineer 
                on duty apparently never bother once to preview it. The result 
                was that the voice level was too low, and the music track, so 
                painstakingly performed for us by volunteers, was inaudible. The 
                color was bad, and the video's ending truncated by a public service 
                announcement. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#000040">Worse, the reaction in South Florida was 
                on the whole negative. Because we had interviewed mostly elderly 
                Cuban Jews whose first decades on the island had been very harsh, 
                and because we did not emphasize the post-WWII economic success 
                of the community, many Cuban-Jewish viewers objected to the academic 
                tone of the narration (Mark and I, after all, are professors of 
                Latin American history) and to the fact that our script delved 
                into such themes as the animosity between Sephardic and Ashkenazic 
                Jews, the lack of interest in helping the German- speaking refugees 
                from Nazism who came after 1936, and the fact that some assimilated 
                Jews, committed to Castro's revolution, stayed behind although 
                the large majority of Cuba's Jews left after 1960. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#000040">Non-Jewish Cubans, as well, were irate, 
                for different reasons. They objected to the script's hypothesis 
                that the reason that Jews and other immigrants fared as well as 
                they did was that Cuban society was corrupt but that outsiders 
                were allowed to buy in--as long as they maintained their social 
                distance. They objected to our references to the fact that the 
                Big Five social clubs barred Jews (as did most of the posh country 
                clubs in the U.S. at the time), and bridled at our allusions to 
                prejudice in Cuba against blacks. Because we did not portray pre-1959 
                Cuba as a paradise, the documentary was castigated. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#000040">Some audiences, however, loved it. It was 
                screened successfully to 200 people at a showing in New York sponsored 
                by the Sephardic Foundation there. A copy of the film was taken 
                to Israel, where it was supposed to have been dubbed into Hebrew. 
                A copy was sent to the Patronato in Havana. Some family members 
                of the elderly people we interviewed--many of whom have died since 
                the video was released in 1986--have expressed their gratitude 
                for telling the story. And although older audiences in the South 
                Florida Cuban-Jewish community continue to react to the video 
                with disdain, younger Cuban-Jewish-Americans invariably praise 
                it. In 1996, "Hotel Cuba" was broadcast nationally on the Arts 
                & Entertainment Network History Channel. </font></p>
