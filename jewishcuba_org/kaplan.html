                          tube off the Florida coast. Americans have endured an 
                          unbelievable barrage of news stories and commentary 
                          about this episode, and most of us are thankful that

                    <td width="380"> 
                      
                  <p> <B> Elian's return to Cuba may have upset many of the anti-Castro 
                    activists in the Florida Cuban-American community,</B> but 
                    polls show that a solid majority of Americans throughout the 
                    rest of the country supported the reunification of Elian and 
                    his father. In Cuba the sentiment is not all that different. 
                    On several recent visits I witnessed Cubans react in mock 
                    horror whenever the name &quot;Elian&quot; was mentioned on 
                    TV or radio. &quot;No more,&quot; they begged me. &quot;No 
                    more! We can't bear to hear any more about Elian.&quot;
                  <p>Despite their "Elian-fatigue" most Cubans support the Communist 
                    regime on this issue. Although they are having a very tough 
                    time economically, it only seems logical to them that Elian 
                    should be returned to his father. Even Juan Miguel Gonzalez' 
                    determination to return to Cuba does not surprise them. He 
                    is, after all, one of Fidel's faithful. "He's going to be 
                    a star here!" one Cuban told me. Another made the motions 
                    of a beard-their symbol for President Castro-and told me "He's 
                    already offered Juan Miguel a number of high-ranking positions." 
                    Furthermore, Juan Miguel has family in Cuba and he genuinely 
                    likes living in the country. Whatever his motivations, most 
                    Cubans seem to feel that if he wants to live in Cuba that's 
                    his choice, and if he wants his son to live in Cardenas with 
                    him, that is also his prerogative. Many Cubans continue to 
                    bemoan their country's economic plight, but a substantial 
                    number have increased their support of the Castro regime as 
                    a direct result of this episode. 
                  <P>The entire issue has certainly focused more 
                          of our attention on Cuba. In addition to the Elian affair, 
                          there have been a number of trade missions, several 
                          prominent defectors, a possible spy, cultural and artistic 
                          exchanges, and even a series of baseball games. All 
                          of this attention has led to curiosity about the Jewish 
                          community on the island, and dramatically increasing 
                          numbers of American Jews are participating in UJA Federation 
                          (now called the United Jewish Communities) missions 
                          to visit the Cuban Jewish community firsthand, bring 
                          food and medicine, and participate in religious and 
                          cultural activities. B'nai B'rith and a number of other 
                          organizations, headquartered not only in Miami but also 
                          in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and elsewhere, 
                          also sponsor such missions. </p>
                        <p>The missions have attracted quite a bit of controversy 
                          in their own right. The Forward, always looking for 
                          a sensationalist angle, published a front-page article 
                          and an accompanying editorial in April 2000 attacking 
                          the frequency and wisdom of the missions. Reporter Melissa 
                          Radler wrote that there were no fewer than 30 missions 
                          to Cuba planned by local federations over the next four 
                          years. In addition, the American Jewish Joint Distribution 
                          Committee spent $142,800 in 1998 to help the 1500 Jews 
                          "it says live in Cuba". Radler cites the 1999 American 
                          Jewish Yearbook estimate that puts the island's Jewish 
                          population at closer to 600. She writes, "Although the 
                          missions aren't subsidized by the Jewish charities, 
                          the cost of travel and accommodations for the 30 groups 
                          headed for Havana dwarfs the amount the Joint is spending 
                          there." <p>

                        <p>The editorial was even harsher. The writer, presumably 
                          then-president and editor Seth Lipsky, wrote that all 
                          of these missions are "enough to make one wonder whether 
                          the reason for all this is merely to help the 600 Jews 
                          trapped in the Communist country. Or will the backers 
                          of the biggest American Jewish charitable structure 
                          emerge with those pressing for a soft line on the Communist 
                          regime during the twilight years of its dictator, Fidel 
                          Castro?" But having visited Cuba a number of times in 
                          the last several months, I can state with certainty 
                          that not all the Jews in the country feel "trapped," 
                          and I witnessed first-hand the wonderful work being 
                          done by the Joint. The money being spent is certainly 
                          substantial, but it covers a full-time community coordinator 
                          brought in from Argentina, programming costs, and other 
                          more concrete forms of aid.</p>
                        <p>In June the same newspaper printed a lengthy letter 
                          from Rabbi Emanuel Viñas of the Bronx. Rabbi Viñas wrote, 
                          "As a Cuban Jew and rabbi living in America, I feel 
                          a personal and professional duty to express my support 
                          for much of what you wrote…Jewish organizations should 
                          not be visiting Cuba as often as they are. Fidel Castro 
                          uses each of these visits to improve his chances of 
                          having the embargo lifted, which would allow him to 
                          continue enslaving the Cuban people at an even greater 
                          profit than at present." Strong words, and by no means 
                          atypical for a Cuban American, Jewish or Christian.</p>
                        <p>But this is certainly not the view of many of those 
                          left in Cuba. It is important to realize that the vast 
                          majority of the Cuban Jewish community emigrated in 
                          the five or six years immediately following the 1959 
                          revolution, and by 1965 only about 10% remained. While 
                          Fidel Castro originally had a tremendous amount of support 
                          from virtually every sector of the population, and was 
                          careful to avoid any overt identification with the Communist 
                          Party or Communist ideology, actions that he took in 
                          the first several months of his rule made it clear that 
                          his government's policies were contrary to the interests 
                          of the middle and upper classes, as well as to foreign 
                          business concerns. A mass exodus of the upper and middle 
                          classes began by early 1960. The few Jews who remained 
                          did so for many reasons, only one of which was ideological 
                          sympathy with Fidel's form of communism. It is not at 
                          all certain that the majority of those who stayed were 
                          ever Communist, and many of those in the community today 
                          either were not born at the time of the revolution or 
                          were small children, and so never made a conscious choice 
                          at all to stay in the country. Nevertheless, it is clear 
                          that after living in Cuba all of these years the Jews 
                          have absorbed many of the attitudes expressed by the 
                          government, which is the only public position that one 
                          can hear on Cuban TV, radio, or newspapers. But many 
                          people still continue to think independently, despite 
                          the efforts made to push the party line.
