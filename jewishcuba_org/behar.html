              <div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">As a Jewish Cuban 
                who grew up in the United States, and having recently visited 
                Cuba twice with Miami-based Jewish Solidarity, it has been both 
                fascinating and deeply troubling to observe American Jews turn 
                Cuban Jews into exotic Jews, picture-opportunity Jews, the last 
                surviving Jews of the communist outback. The Jews of Cuba have 
                become an overstudied tribe, like the !Kung of the Kalahari Desert. 
                </font></div>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">What opened Cuba up 
                to a new kind of American Jewish solidarity traveler was the 1991 
                declaration by Fidel Castro and the Cuban Communist Party that 
                it was acceptable for party members to practice their religious 
                faith. Since then, a sweeping religious and ethnic revitalization 
                has taken place. Not only is Judaism flourishing in four synagogues 
                in Havana and in three communities in the provinces, but so too 
                are Catholic, Protestant, Quaker, and Afrocuban religions. Each 
                of these religious groups, in turn, has its supporters in the 
                United States, who organize visits and bring food, medicines, 
                religious book, office supplies, and other aid to Cuba. None of 
                the three films under review tries to place the Jewish Cuban community 
                within this larger context of religious revitalization. As a result, 
                the novice viewer will come away from the films believing that 
                the Jews in Cuba are doing their "Jewish thing" in a social vacuum, 
                rather than in relation to broad transformations taking place 
                in Cuban society as a whole. </font> 
              <p align="left"> <font face="Arial" size="-1">"The Believers" and 
                "Abraham and Eugenia" by Bonnie Burt come out of her two visits 
                to Cuba with Jewish solidarity groups. I was with Burt on her 
                second visit and was present during most of the shooting of the 
                sections on Abraham Berezniak for the latter film. Unlike some 
                other journalists on the trip, Burt was not obnoxious in her use 
                of the camera. Both her films are independent one-woman productions, 
                which make the most of her quiet and unobstrusive low-tech approach. 
                </font> 
              <p align="left"> <font face="Arial" size="-1">"The Believers" offers 
                a mix of footage about the Jewish Cuban community with street 
                scenes in which outspoken elderly women and charming schoolboys 
                talk about the dire shortages of food, transportation, and pen 
                and paper. Interviewed in depth are Berezniak, the kosher butcher 
                of Havana and secretary of the Jewish burial society; Adela Dworin, 
                librarian of the Patronato Synagogue; and Alina Fenhandler, a 
                29-year-old doctor who converted to Judaism and speaks daringly 
                - in perfect English - about her fear of standing in her kitchen 
                and wondering what she will be able to feed her two childen on 
                any given day (Is she still in Cuba? I didn't see here when I 
                returned in July of 1995). These Jewish Cubans offer insight into 
                their quest for roots, comparing their present situation to the 
                fear that made it impossible for them to practice Judaism openly 
                in the past. As Berezniak says, two years ago most people didn't 
                know the aleph. Now, with the creation of a "escuelita," both 
                children and adults are learning Hebrew and the rudiments of the 
                liturgy. But this Jewish Cuban world is vulnerable, Burt suggests, 
                to the larger crisis taking place beyond the synagogue doors. 
                A woman standing in front of the kosher butcher shop in Old Havana 
                declares that only people with dollars can eat in Cuba today. 
                Unfortunately, Burt stops short of asking whether she resents 
                the fact that Jewish Cubans listed as synagogue members can get 
                rations of kosher meat at times when no meat of any kind is available 
                to other Cubans. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Although Burt's film 
                in titled "The Believers," in the end we don't learn what has 
                motivated Jewish Cubans to return to Judaism. Is their newfound 
                spirituality a form of resistance? Or a solace in times of crisis? 
                What does being a believer mean to the many members of the community 
                who have married into Judaism or are reclaiming their identify 
                from a long-lost Jewish grandparent? It is painful to admit, but 
                the search for faith is uncomfortably aligned with the desire 
                for those things of the world that are currently pouring into 
                the synagogues from external humanitarian aid. At the moment when 
                state stores and pharmacies are empty (as Burt shows in her film), 
                in the synagogues Jewish Cubans will find food, clothes, medicines, 
                and the pens the schoolboys are asking Burt to give them just 
                before her camera cuts them off. </font> 
              <p align="left"> <font face="Arial" size="-1">"Abraham and Euginia" 
                is more focused, looking in depth at two life stories, that of 
                Berezniak in Havana and Eugenia Farin in Santiago de Cuba. Berezniak 
                gives a history of the Jewish community as he roams through the 
                two Jewish cemetaries in Guanabacoa accompanied by members of 
                Jewish Solidarity. The journey to Jewish Cuba always begins with 
                dead Cuban Jews. He notes the monuments for the six million Jews 
                killed in the Holocaust and the Jewish communists killed by the 
                Machado government, and points to the tomb of Saul Yelin, a secular 
                Jew who founded the Cuban Film Institute after the revolution. 
                </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">All the children who 
                attended the Jewish day school, as well as their teacher, left 
                Cuba during the 1980 Mariel boatlift. But now, says Berezniak, 
                there has been a resurgence of Judaism. Indeed, we witness the 
                process of Jewish continuity and revival as Berezniak's own son 
                becomes a bar mitzvah in the Adath Israel synagogue in Old Havana, 
                on the very same <i>bima</i>&#160;where Berezniak himself became 
                a bar mitzvah. That Jewish moment is followed by an exquisitely 
                Cuban moment as the guests sit down to eat lunch to the sounds 
                of a trio playing "Son de la loma," a classical song of the <i>son 
                montuno</i>&#160; tradition. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Yet overall the version 
                of Berezniak's life presented in Burt's film is an "official story." 
                For example, the fact that the Adath Israel congregation to which 
                Berezniak belongs is under the control of the Lubavitcher and 
                that this has caused controversy in the Jewish Cuban community 
                is not discussed. Although Berezniak alludes to the difficulties 
                of being an Orthodox Jew in Cuba, Burt doesn't pursue this discussion. 
                Berezniak says at one point that it is easier to assimilate than 
                to live a Jewish life. In his own case, he married a non-Jewish 
                woman who converted to Judaism only in the last two years. Burt 
                includes clips of Berezniak's wife on the day of the bar mitzvah, 
                but isn't able to get her to discuss the difficulties she may 
                have experienced in converting to Judaism and finding that the 
                Lubavitch do not accept her as a Jew. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Eugenia Fair's story, 
                in the second part of the film, is a gem. Engenia is a gifted 
                storyteller wih an endearing and moving story to tell. She makes 
                us recognize just how tenuous is the "and" that joins the two 
                stories. Not only are Abraham and Eugenia unrelated and living 
                on either end of the island, but they are at opposite ends of 
                the spectrum with regard to their approach toward religion. Eugenia 
                is in the early phases of fascination with religion; she is enveloped 
                in the charisma of a Jew just returning to her faith with nostalgia, 
                longing, and fervent hope. Abraham, on the other hand, has been 
                at his faith longer and his practice is more routinized. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">The juxtaposition of 
                their two stories inadvertently shows the crucial role played 
                by foreign Jewish solidarity groups in bolstering Judaism in Cuba. 
                On the positive side, this attention, like foreign attention to 
                human rights, protects Jews from posible persecution and anti-Semitism 
                (which the three films continually insist do not exist in Cuba). 
                On the negative side, this attention creates situations in which 
                Jewish Cubans are put in the position of having to perform their 
                identity for outsiders, to put on a "show" for Jewish visitors 
                who want to bring back souvenirs of their trips, evidence that 
                the Jews of Cuba are doing Jewish things, like celebrating Shabbat 
                and Passover and learning Israeli dances. That level of foreign 
                attention will probably never plague Santiago because of its distance 
                from Havana, but some of it is now reaching its Jews too. The 
                Jews of Santiago reclaimed their synagogue in July of 1995 (largely 
                through the efforts of their extraordinary leader Rebeca Boton 
                Behar) and their religious practice is just beginning to get off 
                the ground. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">So it is with truly 
                unrehearsed and genuine emotion that Eugenia tells of the difficulties 
                that confronted her and her two sisters when they came of age 
                and had to try to live up to the dictum that to marry a non-Jew 
                was a sin. How could they keep from sinning when the majority 
                of Jews had left Cuba? The Farin sisters waited until they were 
                almost thrity to make a decision. Finally they realized, notes 
                Eugenia, that it would be a greater sin not to marry, for that 
                would break the continuity of the generations. Having openly confronted 
                the reality of intermarriage, Eugenia speaks with pride of her 
                non-Jewish husband, who doesn't interfere with, nor participate 
                in, her efforts to educate her daughters in the Jewish faith. 
                With the tears brimming in her eyes, she says that her daughters 
                have never heard the sound of the shofar, have never heard the 
                old chants. "Maybe," she says, "Everything isn't over for us. 
                It is beginning now." </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Written and directed 
                by Laura Paull, "Havana Nagilah" is a sophisticated documentary 
                that offers a sweeping narrative of Jewish Cuban history from 
                conquest times through independence, the struggles for nationhood, 
                the Batista period, and the revolution. With articulate voiceover 
                commentary, excellent sound track, and a range of well-chosen 
                voices, Paull's one-hour film is more high-tech than Burt's two 
                short films. It comes across more authoritatively, though it lacks 
                the creative quirkiness and depth of feeling expressed in Burt's 
                films. While Burt is interested in portraying Jewish Cubans who 
                are believers, Paull gives more attention to Jewish Cubans who 
                are intellectuals, questioning their faith and their traditions 
                even as they express pride in their identity as Jews. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Paull is to be commended 
                for her fascinating interviews with secular Cuban Jews who have 
                been involved with the revolutionary process and consider that 
                their Jewish identity, at least initially, found expression through 
                participation in the cause of social justice. Among those interviewed 
                are the architect Luis Lapidus (an important thinker and activist 
                in the restoration of Old Havana who died suddenly of cancer in 
                1995), the oral surgeon Dr. Jose' Miller (the eloquent leader 
                of the Patronato synagogue and Jewish community of Havana), Adela 
                Dworin (the Patronato librarian who is also an Orthodox Jew), 
                Rosa Behar (a gastroenterologist of Sephardic background who is 
                the newly appointed leader of the Hadassah chapter in Cuba), and 
                Moises Assis (a key figure in the Jewish Cuban revival movement 
                who speaks of having had to go underground as a Jew to attain 
                a university education and who has since emigated to Miami). Of 
                special interest is the inclusion of two non-Jewish thinkers who 
                offer key insights into the Jewish Cuban community - Maritza Corrales, 
                a historian at the University of Havana who is the most knowledgeable 
                and serious scholar of Jewish Cuban history, and Anton Arrufat, 
                a major Cuban playwright, who reflects candidly on his family's 
                prejudices toward Jews and how they were gradually overcome through 
                friendship with a Jewish neighbor in the Santiago of the 1940s 
                and 1950s. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">One of the most important 
                insights offered by "Havana Nagilah" is that the contemporary 
                Jewish Cuban community is a <i>new</i>&#160;community that rose 
                from the ashes of the Jewish Cuban community that emigrated to 
                the United States after the revolution. The old community coped 
                with the challenge of rising from peddlers to merchants while 
                maintaining their identity through a closed social system of Jewish 
                schools and institutions. The new community, on the other hand, 
                has had to come to terms with thirty years of intermarriage, acculturation, 
                economic hardship, and the pressure to conform to the rules of 
                a secular state, in which "new men" and "new women" would remake 
                society. It is clear that the Jews who stayed in Cuba after the 
                revolution were those who were least involved in Jewish community 
                life before the revolution. Most had already married non-Jews 
                or would later do so out of necessity. A few idealists, like Luis 
                Lapidus, stayed in Cuba because they wanted to build a new, more 
                inclusive Cuban society and rejected the values of the closed 
                Jewish society that his family had tried to inculcate in him. 
                </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">It would have been 
                interesting if Paull had explored why so few Jews felt as committed 
                to the Cuban nationalist project of 1959 as did Lapidus and others 
                of those interviewed. Certainly, the Jewish community in Cuba 
                was a young community, just twenty-five years old when Fidel Castro 
                took Havana. Most of the Jews arrived after the 1924 Immigration 
                and Exclusion Act and it was their first-generation offspring, 
                many of them just beginning to raise families of their own, who 
                had to confront the difficult decision of whether to stay or leave 
                after the revolution. The community froze prematurely in time 
                and had to remake itself in the diaspora. It was also a community 
                made up primarily of business people, with only a handful of intellectuals 
                and writers who might have articulated a coherent vision of Jewish 
                Cuban identity. Despite the fact that Cuba was hospitable to Jews, 
                one wonderes whether, in some profound sense that has yet to be 
                studied, Jewish Cubans could not be fully integrated into the 
                Cuban national project. Is it an accident that all those Jewish 
                Cubans interviewed dowplayed their Jewishness until recently? 
                Perhaps, in the early years, Jewish identity posed too unsettling 
                a contradiction for a revolution that was so utterly nationalist?</font><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="-1">

              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Finally, although these 
                films are by no means insensitive, they don't even begin to analyze 
                the situation that made them possible in the first place - the 
                new "encounter" between privileged American Jews and desperately 
                needy Jews in Cuba, many of whom would happily leave the island 
                with their helpers, if only they could. How can American Jews 
                offer a helping hand without humiliating those on whom they bestow 
                their charity? How can American Jews return to Cuba to help without 
                reproducing a new set of colonial relations, this time betwen 
                the United States and the Jews of Cuba? These are the central, 
                difficult questions that need to be addressed - in film, in writing, 
                in our consciences.</font>
