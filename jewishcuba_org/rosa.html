      <td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="+1">Rosa Behar 
        - A doctor on a mission </font></b></font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Rosa Behar radiates 
          energy, whether sitting, standing, or more likely, moving quickly and 
          with confidence toward one of her many involvements. Dr. Behar is a 
          gastroenterologiest and Department Chair in Havana's Calixto Garcia 
          Hospital. She is also a wife, mother, grandparent, and a dedicated volunteer 
          in charge of the Patronato (Havana´s Jewish Community Center) pharmacy. 
          Her husband, Aleop Tur Gutiérrez, is a retired marine engineer and Captain 
          in Cuba's Merchant Marines.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Rosa works in 
          an environment where simple items like vitamin C are in short supply, 
          and more complex needs such as asthma inhalers are almost non-existent. 
          </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> It has become 
          Rosa´s personal mission to provide for the medical needs of her community, 
          both Jewish and non-Jewish. Reaching her current professional and personal 
          success has been a demanding journey. </font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> In the 1930s Rosa´s 
          father left Cuba to study in France´s Sorbonne. While there he fell 
          in love, married, and Rosa was born. Shortly before WWII began Rosa's 
          father, his wife, and Rosa left France and moved to Cuba. Rosa attended 
          schools in Cuba and received her medical degree from the University 
          of Havana.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> While the Soviet 
          influence was strong in Cuba Rosa made around 700 pesos a month, roughly 
          equivalent in those days to 700 dollars a month, an excellent salary 
          by Cuban standards. When the Soviet empire fell apart and support for 
          Cuba ended, Cuba entered what is called a "special period." Rosa´s salary 
          diminished to around $30 a month, which is where it is today. "It makes 
          things difficult," she says with characteristic modesty. </font>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> In spite of the 
          personal hardships caused by the "Special Period," Rosa has looked beyond 
          herself and, as part of a team of four, has created a pharmacy which 
          provides medicine free of charge to the Patronato´s neighbors and to 
          the outlying Jewish communities. She credits her daughter Rebeca, a 
          licensed pharmacist, with the original idea. </font> 
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"We had two small 
          boxes of medicine donated to us," Rosa says, "and Rebeca looked at them 
          and asked why we shouldn´t take these donations, distribute them to 
          people in need, and then ask for more." The Patronato Farmacia was born. 
          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Because the four 
          individuals who run the pharmacy all have professional jobs and limited 
          time, the pharmacy is only open formally on Tuesdays from two until 
          four, although it takes longer to serve all the people waiting. In that 
          short time an average of 50 families will receive medicine. Additionally, 
          staff members come into the pharmacy in their spare time and prepare 
          boxes of medicine for other Jewish communities, ranging from as far 
          away as Santiago de Cuba, 869 kilometers away in eastern Cuba, and Guantanamo, 
          a small community near the American military base. </font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Patients are required 
          to have a prescription from their family doctor, and if the pharmacy 
          has the medicine it is free. Otherwise the patients needs to seek out 
          the medicine in the "peso" market, where little is available, or on 
          the "dollar" market, where most items seem to appear. Cuba is increasingly 
          moving toward an economy based on the United States dollar. Those with 
          access to dollars can get by. Those without access suffer. <img src="art22.jpg" width="158" height="241" align="left" vspace="6" hspace="8" alt="June Safran photo"></font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Typical medical 
          problems faced by Cubans include asthma, hypertension, ulcers, and diabetes 
          type 2. When asked what was in shortest supply, Rosa replies "Vitamins 
          C and E, and asthma spray, particularly the replacement bottles for 
          the inhalers." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Donations today 
          come primarily from the numerous Jewish groups which visit the synagogue. 
          In a recent visit from a Boston (United States) congregation, each participant 
          brought a flight bag filled with different medicines. Rosa and her team 
          methodically go through these donations, categorizing them and organizing 
          them for individuals and for other destinations, such as hospitals.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Rosa particularly 
          enjoys working with young children as a member of Hadassah (she is president 
          of the Havana chapter), delivering medicine to them in Sunday school, 
          and working with their families in educational programs designed to 
          prevent disease. Rosa is also chairman of the Patronato woman's group, 
          a growing and active organization.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Rosa is not alone 
          in her volunteer work with the pharmacy. In addition to her daughter 
          Dr. Rebeca Tur Behar, she is helped by Dr. Tamara Rousso, and Professor 
          Lourdes Albo. In terms of outside help, she credits the JDC with helping 
          strengthen Cuba´s Jewish community, Stan Cohen of B´nai B´rith´s Cuban 
          Jewish Relief Project, June Safran of the Cuba-America Jewish Mission, 
          and Diego and Laura Mendelbaum, Ivan and Cynthia Glait, Nestor Szewach 
          and Mara Steiner. </font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Dr. Behar brings 
          a combination of intensity and joy to her volunteer work, working quickly 
          to fill prescriptions, but taking a few moments to answer a patient´s 
          questions. Her energy seems to spread to others, and those who have 
          spoken with her seem to move away from her with more enthusiasm. </font>
