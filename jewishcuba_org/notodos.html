                Oral Histories from the Cuban Jewish Community </b></font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial">“No Todos Nos Fuimos [Not All of Us Left]” 
                will be a one hour documentary exploring the history, memory, 
                and everyday lives of the Cuban Jewish community in their own 
                words. By interweaving oral histories, archival images, home movies, 
                voice overs of memoirs and poetry, and trips through Jewish neighborhoods 
                old and new, the film will chronicle recurring waves of community-building 
                and diaspora. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial"><b><font color="#000099">Project History </font></b></font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial">The originators of “No Todos Nos Fuimos” were 
                members of El Patronato Community Center in Havana - such as Lourdes 
                Albo Puentes, Adela Dworin, and Dr. José Miller. They felt that 
                it was urgent to begin recording the memories of “los de tercer 
                edad” [the senior citizens], as they were the last surviving members 
                of the community who had lived through, and could remember, the 
                bulk of its history. This sentiment was supported by younger members 
                of the congregation - such as Liver Maya, Deborah Bradman, and 
                Alberto Popovsky - who felt such a project would be a valuable 
                legacy for their generation, many of whom grew up without ever 
                being exposed to this history. </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">New York-based 
                director Miriam Greenberg became involved after travelling to 
                Cuba in 1998 as a translator on the American Jewish Joint Distribution 
                Committee&#8217;s [JDC] medical aid mission. Once she found out 
                about the oral history project, she volunteered to coordinate 
                the effort, and was provided with initial start-up funds by the 
                JDC. Since then she has worked with members of El Patronato to 
                record over 60 hours of oral histories with members of the community 
                around Havana &#8212; including El Patronato, Chevet Achim, and 
                Adath Yisroel congregations &#8212; <br>
                as well as across the island &#8212; including Santa Clara, Camaguey, 
                and Santiago de Cuba. She is working now to weave these into a 
                documentary film, and to create a permanent video archive at El 
                Patronato.</font><br>

              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial">The interviews cover the following historical 
                themes: </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial">• The early waves of immigration from the 
                United States, Turkey, Syria, and Eastern and Western Europe, 
                in the terms of the forces driving them and the experience of 
                discovering Cuba. </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial">• The economic, political, and cultural 
                life of the earliest “barrios Judios,” [Jewish neighborhoods], 
                such as Havana Vieja, and how they developed in the 20’s, 30’s, 
                and 40’s. </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial">• The experience of WWII, in terms 
                of the shock of hearing about the Holocaust, the response of the 
                community, and the arrival of the refugees at that time </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial">• The post-WWII economic boom, when many Jews 
                were able to move into middle class neighborhoods and build new 
                synagogues. </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial">• The impact of the Cuban Revolution after 
                which 90% of the community left for the U.S, Latin America, and 
                Israel -- how this was experiened by those who left, and those 
                who stayed behind. </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial">• The aftermath of the Revolution, in terms 
                of the new life those who emigrated created in Miami, and the 
                efforts of those who stayed “to keep the candle of the community 
                lit” in the face of many difficulties. </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial">• The period after 1989, when religious 
                restrictions were loosened in Cuba, and since when what some call 
                a “renacimiento” [rebirth] of Jewish traditions and education 
                has occured </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial">Within these broad historical parameters, 
                “No Todos Nos Fuimos” seeks to be as representative as possible, 
                gathering oral histories from Ashkenazis and Sephardis; orthodox, 
                conservative, reform, and secular Jews; men and women; and those 
                to the right, left, and center of the political spectrum. And 
                while the majority of the interviewees are members of the older 
                generation, we seek the perspective of those of the second and 
                third generation as well. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial"><b><font color="#000099">Cinematic Approach 
                </font></b></font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial">The oral histories themselves take 
                place in people’s homes as well as in places of historical significance 
                to the Cuban Jewish community, such as synagogues, old Jewish 
                neighborhoods, and the sites of old cultural organizations and 
                schools. In addition, through voiceovers the film will incorporate 
                a wealth of poetry and prose produced by the community in a number 
                of Cuban Jewish newspapers, publications, and personal memoirs. 
                Both the interviews and voiceovers will be intercut with archival 
                footage including: photographs, home movies, newsreels, newspaper 
                articles, maps, and other important documents. </font></p>

              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After taking 
                three trips to Cuba, and shooting 60 hours of footage, Miriam 
                Greenberg is now working on editing a final cut of the film.</font></p>

                director </font></b></font></p>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial">Miriam Greenberg has been an independent 
                documentary producer and video teacher for many years, with a 
                particular interest in oral histories. This began with a project 
                gathering oral histories from the longtime residents of East Palo 
                Alto, California, which was ultimately made into the award-winning 
                documentary, East Palo Alto: Dreams of a City. She also spent 
                five years helping to create the El Puente Media and Technology 
                Center in the Puerto Rican and Dominican neighborhood of Williamsburg, 
                Brooklyn. There she worked with young people to produce videos 
                on a topics ranging from youth culture to lead poisoning, which 
                aired on public access and PBS stations nationwide. She is also 
                pursuing her doctorate in Sociology at the City University of 
                New York Graduate Center, and is Assistant Professor in Media 
                and Cultural Studies at Pratt Institute.</font> <br>
