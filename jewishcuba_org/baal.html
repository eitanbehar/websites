                              Alberto's journey to becoming a Baal Kore began 
                              with an idea by Diego Mandelbaum, JDC's representative 
                              in Cuba. "In so many ways, Cuba has become its own 
                              Jewish resource. This seemed like a logical step. 
                              It helps that Alberto is a true scholar," says Mandelbaum. 
                              "When we started he could scarcely read Hebrew. 
                              But he had the desire. We decided on a two-month 
                              course of study. In the process, he learned much 
                              more than the musical symbols he would need. He 
                              studied commentaries and reflections on the Torah. 
                              He moved beyond the technique of reading the Torah 
                              and investigated the spiritual and emotional meaning 
                              contained in each portion. When you hear him read, 
                              you can sense his fufillment."</font></p>
                            <p> &nbsp; <font face=ARIAL>Alberto's elation is multiplied 
                              in the responses of those who come to hear him read. 
                              "When he reads the Torah in a Cuban voice, I know 
                              that this is our Torah, too -- not something from 
                              the outside," smiled an older woman in the congregation. 
                              "Here in Cuba," she continues, "We have a strong 
                              community. Now we are enjoying some fruit from our 
                              strength. If Menorah, (Cuba's national Jewish newspaper) 
                              is the eyes of our people, Alberto is our voice."
