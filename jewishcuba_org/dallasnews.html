                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> This is 
                  a difficult time for American Jews. With Passover beginning 
                  at sundown Wednesday, many will say a prayer for Israel, a spiritual 
                  home they see as being under siege. </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> But for 
                  a small contingent of Jews living in Dallas, another "home" 
                  crosses their mind as often as Jerusalem. And just as they do 
                  every year, they will pray for Cuba as well. </font>
                <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Ah, Cuba," 
                  says Zoila Sandler, whose friends call her Sonia. With a dreamy 
                  voice and eyes to match, she describes her former home as "a 
                  wonderful, wonderful, beautiful island, with beautiful people, 
                  beautiful places to go ... very friendly, beautiful schools."

                  Savariego family, about 1945 in Cuba: Coty (left), Noemi and 
                  Sam with parents Donna and Jose. </b></font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Coty came 
                  to Dallas with husband Moses Eskenazi in 1962. Now in her 70s, 
                  Mrs. Sandler chose to leave Cuba in November 1963, saying goodbye 
                  to "Old Havana," the flora and fauna, the palm trees and the 
                  beach at Varadero, with its thick white sand and turquoise water, 
                  where each night "a million stars" covered her like a blissful 
                  canopy. </font>
                <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"I had 
                  a beautiful childhood in Cuba," she says. "We were poor people. 
                  My mother often lacked the money to buy groceries, even though 
                  my father was a great working man. But life at that time was 
                  not so expensive. </font>
                <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"In many 
                  ways, I miss Cuba. I would love to go back, if only to visit 
                  my old house and Old Havana, where I grew up. Most of my years 
                  there were happy ones. It was there that I married a wonderful 
                  man and gave birth to our three children." </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> But today, 
                  Mrs. Sandler has been a resident of Dallas for 38 years. Most 
                  of her fellow exiles who happen to be Jewish have been here 
                  even longer. Just as she does, they carry with them a litany 
                  of heart-wrenching stories. </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> They gave 
                  up everything or had it taken away. They arrived in Dallas penniless 
                  and overwhelmed, having to reconstruct lives torn asunder, much 
                  as their European relatives did in the wake of the Holocaust. 
                  </font>
                <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"We were 
                  allowed to leave Cuba with only two changes of clothing and 
                  only one pair of shoes," says Mrs. Sandler. En route to Dallas, 
                  she and her husband had their suitcases stolen in Mexico, leaving 
                  them only with the clothes they were wearing. They also lost 
                  one of their prized possessions, the family photo collection. 
                  </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> <b>What 
                  was lost </b></font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> For Moses 
                  and Coty Eskenazi, the situation was much the same. They gave 
                  up a thriving dry-goods business near Havana and a newly constructed 
                  3,500-square-foot home with marble floors. They arrived in Dallas 
                  in January 1962 with almost no money and only the prospects 
                  of a blue-collar job. </font>
                <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"We lost 
                  all our properties, and our bank accounts were confiscated," 
                  says Mr. Eskenazi, 72, who went on to become one of Dallas' 
                  most successful insurance brokers. He later became part-owner 
                  of a company that manufactured steel machinery. <br>

                  Eskenazis, shown in the late 1930s, came to Cuba in the 1920s 
                  after migrating from Turkey. Moses is seated in the front row 
                  (center); his parents are in the back row (center). </font></b> 
                  </font></font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Though 
                  no one has exact estimates, the Jewish Federation of Greater 
                  Dallas says the Sandlers and Eskenazis are among several hundred 
                  families of Cuban Jewish origin living in North Texas. Officials 
                  for the Miami-based Latin American Sephardic Federation say 
                  that, with a population of several thousand, Texas is home to 
                  one of the largest concentrations of Cuban Jews outside Florida, 
                  whose estimates exceed 20,000. </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Mrs. Sandler 
                  says Dallas' Cuban Jews still hold celebrations, though not 
                  as often as before. When the families began arriving in the 
                  1960s, their children were young. Even the grandparents were 
                  still alive. Generations of bar and bat mitzvahs have come and 
                  gone, as have weddings and anniversaries. </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Synagogues 
                  "did all they could" to embrace the new arrivals, says Mrs. 
                  Sandler, noting that Tiferet Israel, Shearith Israel and Temple 
                  Emanu-El all offered free one-year memberships to anyone emigrating 
                  from Cuba. But even when the Cuban Jewish social scene was at 
                  its peak, its get-togethers often included Gentiles. "We would 
                  celebrate on Jan. 28, the birthday of [Cuban national hero] 
                  Jose Marti," says Mrs. Sandler, "and we would celebrate on May 
                  20, which marks Cuba's independence from Spain. And we still 
                  do that. </font>
                <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Our celebrations 
                  included Catholics, Protestants and Jews, as well as black people, 
                  Chinese people, Hispanic people. The one thing we all had in 
                  common was being from Cuba. But many of the older people, they 
                  [died], and the younger people, instead of being 14 or 15, are 
                  now 51 or 52." </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> <b>Collective 
                  bitterness </b></font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Even today, 
                  most remain united in a feeling of collective bitterness toward 
                  the Marxist regime of Fidel Castro, who seized power in the 
                  revolution of 1959, toppling corrupt dictator Fulgencio Batista. 
                  The Castro government soon began seizing all private land holdings 
                  as well as businesses and bank accounts. Churches and synagogues 
                  suffered, too, with many shutting their doors for good. </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Though 
                  never accused of anti-Semitism, Castro was, say the exiles, 
                  intolerant of religion as a whole, as was the Kremlin that financed 
                  his efforts until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989. Castro's 
                  critics contend that, until he allowed the visit of Pope John 
                  Paul II in 1998, churches and synagogues were forced to operate 
                  largely in secret. </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> But since 
                  then, the situation has changed, and in some ways, changed dramatically. 
                  </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Gary Weinstein, 
                  executive vice president of the Jewish Federation of Greater 
                  Dallas, accompanied a delegation of 30 civic and business leaders 
                  from Dallas' Jewish community on a tour of Cuba two years ago. 
                  </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> They experienced 
                  what he calls "a rejuvenation of Jewish life in Cuba, a reconnection 
                  to the Jewish religion and a revival of Jewish culture." The 
                  Dallas group raised more than $50,000 to provide for Cuba's 
                  1,800 remaining Jews "a Friday night Shabbat [Sabbath] dinner 
                  for two full years." </font>
                <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"They 
                  can't afford meat," says Mr. Weinstein, "and they can afford 
                  chicken only twice a month." </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> He, too, 
                  noticed that synagogues are re-emerging all across Cuba. And 
                  several new books examine the lives of Cuban Jews. Among the 
                  more prominent are a novel titled Days of Awe, by Achy Obejas 
                  (Ballantine, $24.95), and a memoir, The Last Minyan in Havana, 
                  by Betty Heisler-Samuels (Chutzpah Publishing, $14.95). There 
                  also is a new Web site, <b><a href="http://www.jewishcuba.org">www.jewishcuba.org</a></b>. 
                  </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> But old 
                  feelings are hard to shake. Mr. Weinstein says no one in the 
                  Dallas contingent who flew to Cuba two years ago had ever lived 
                  there. In other words, no one in "the funding group" who made 
                  the trip was a member of the city's exile community. Many of 
                  Dallas' Cuban transplants have mixed feelings or claim to have 
                  no desire to return to a land where too many bad memories mingle 
                  with the good. </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> <b>Leaving 
                  anti-Semitism</b> </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Coming 
                  from a long line of Ashkenazi (Eastern European) Jews, Mrs. 
                  Sandler's family left their home in Minsk, in the former Soviet 
                  Union, in 1929, motivated by a desire to leave behind both communism 
                  and anti-Semitism. </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> During 
                  the Holocaust in Europe, Cuba was a place to feel safe, she 
                  says, never knowing that it, too, would be a home she and her 
                  family would want to leave. </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> By 1962, 
                  she and her late husband, Manuel Sandler, had seen their lucrative 
                  family business (manufacturing a line of apparel for boys) and 
                  their bank accounts confiscated by the Castro government. They 
                  had sent their oldest son and daughter to live with relatives 
                  in 1961 and wouldn't see them again for two years. It was "the 
                  darkest point in our lives," she says. </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Her children 
                  Benny, 52; Silvia, 48; and Fabio, 45 (who later changed his 
                  name to Fabian) were all born in Havana. For two years, however, 
                  Benny and Silvia lived apart from their parents, staying with 
                  relatives in the United States. </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Mr. Eskenazi 
                  and his wife, Coty, 67, suffered a similar fate. They had just 
                  finished building a lavish new home with marble flooring throughout 
                  even in the garage! Within months of seeing it completed, they 
                  had to leave it behind. </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> As a member 
                  of what he calls "the counterrevolution" in his hometown of 
                  Artemisa, Mr. Eskenazi was arrested three times. On one occasion, 
                  after the ill-fated Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961 a U.S.-backed 
                  effort by Cuban exiles to reclaim their homeland he was detained 
                  for three days, along with thousands of other dissidents. </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> At that 
                  point, "I saw the handwriting on the wall," he says, and prompted 
                  by his wife's urgings, made plans to leave immediately. </font>
                <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"They 
                  wanted to take our children and have them be 'scouts,' " he 
                  says. "This wasn't the Boy Scouts, you understand. Castro was 
                  taking them to be in service to his new government." </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Mrs. Sandler 
                  describes the specter of losing one's children as "a panic" 
                  that ripped through Cuba like a plague in the early 1960s. In 
                  her opinion, that alone was the reason for so many Cubans, Jewish 
                  or otherwise, to want to leave as fast as possible. </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Through 
                  the backing of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), the 
                  Eskenazis were flown to Kingston, Jamaica, in October 1961 and 
                  waited there for six weeks. If anything, says Mrs. Eskenazi, 
                  it made them feel a kinship with their ancestors, Sephardic 
                  Jews who had migrated from Judea in 90 A.D. to Spain to Turkey 
                  and then to Cuba in the 1920s. When they arrived in Dallas, 
                  Mr. Eskenazi took a job unloading boxcars. He routinely had 
                  to lift 100-pound bags for six days a week, earning $75 for 
                  his labor. </font>
                <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"After 
                  a while, they realized that maybe I was a little bit intelligent," 
                  he says. "I quit at one point. I just couldn't take it any longer. 
                  But then I went back and worked for another year until a good 
                  friend of mine, working for an insurance company, hired my brother 
                  Simon. For one year, Simon led Texas in selling insurance, and 
                  then he hired me and I led the nation [in sales] for two and 
                  a half years." Eventually the Eskenazis built a home near Royal 
                  Lane and stayed there for 25 years before moving into a high-rise 
                  luxury condominium. Their children Sammy, 45 (who followed his 
                  father into the insurance business); Sara, 44; and Josie, 35 
                  remain in the Dallas area. </font>

                  of a culture </b></font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> As a boy 
                  of 4, Sammy Eskenazi remembers hiding in the kitchen as members 
                  of Castro's army stormed the family home looking for his father. 
                  But despite such a grim memory, he loves shopping at La Favorita, 
                  a Cuban grocery near Bachman Lake, and buying Cuban sandwiches 
                  and pastries at Carrollton's International Bakery. </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Mrs. Eskenazi 
                  says her family still craves Cuban food, and for a recent Friday 
                  night Shabbat, that's exactly what she cooked for a visiting 
                  nephew, who came from Turkey via the University of Richmond 
                  in Virginia. She cooked arroz con pollo (chicken with rice), 
                  black beans and fried plantation bananas, just like they make 
                  at La Bodeguita del Medio, one of Havana's most popular restaurants, 
                  once frequented by the likes of Errol Flynn and Ernest Hemingway. 
                  </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> As much 
                  as he likes the food, Moses Eskenazi says his family has no 
                  desire to return to Cuba, even for a visit. </font>
                <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"If Castro 
                  had never come, we would still be in Cuba, and we would be happy," 
                  says his wife. "But we love it here. Dallas is our home and 
                  always will be. We raised our children here, and now we have 
                  grandchildren here. Dallas has been very, very good to us. In 
                  our opinion, it's a wonderful place. And it is our home." </font>
