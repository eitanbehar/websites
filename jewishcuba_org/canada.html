                The Globe and Mail <br>
                Monday, October 11, 1999 </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Canada has served as 
                the behind-the-scenes expediter in a hitherto secret deal between 
                Cuba and Israel that has allowed hundreds of Cuban Jews to emigrate 
                to Israel over the past 25 years, Canadian officials revealed 
                last night. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">"I think it is an example 
                of how Canada's constructive engagement with Cuba is working to 
                our advantage quietly and successfully," an official in Foreign 
                Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy's office said. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Cuba has no formal 
                diplomatic ties with Israel, having cut relations after Israel's 
                1973 victory in the Yom Kippur War. Cuban President Fidel Castro 
                has been accused of supplying arms to Palestinian terrorist groups. 
                </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">News of the emigration 
                of Cuban Jews to Israel broke in Europe over the weekend. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">The astonishing thing 
                is that the arrangement, facilitated by Canada, has been going 
                on for a quarter century without word of it leaking out. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Since 1974, the official 
                in Mr. Axworthy's office said, Canada has had a special office 
                in the Canadian embassy in Havana serving as facilitator for Cuban 
                Jews wanting to leave for Israel. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">"What happens is that 
                we're used as basically an intermediary between the two countries. 
                An application would go to our officer in Havana, who would send 
                it on to the Israel embassy here [in Ottawa] and forward it on 
                to Tel Aviv. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">"And if it was approved, 
                the chain would operate in reverse." </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">The official said those 
                approved would leave Cuba using a Cuban exit visa and passport, 
                but they would be issued Canadian travel documents entitling them 
                to enter Israel. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">"The long and short 
                of it is that it is nothing new," the official said. "It operates 
                with full transparency, so the Israelis know, the Cubans know, 
                obviously we know. And everyone is happy with it." </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">The official said he 
                believes about 400 Cuban Jews have emigrated using this process 
                over the past 10 to 15 years. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">He said the arrangement 
                has been kept secret "for simple diplomatic reasons," adding: 
                "Given the relationship between the countries involved, keeping 
                it quiet was the best idea." </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">A spokesman for the 
                Israeli embassy in Ottawa said the embassy had no comment. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">According to some reports, 
                Cuba and Israel are interested in re-establishing ties but Israel 
                is cautious because of fear of upsetting Washington, which maintains 
                a nearly 40-year economic embargo on the Caribbean island nation. 
                </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Sergio Karas, a Spanish-speaking, 
                Toronto-based immigration lawyer, said in an interview yesterday 
                that Cuba's Jewish population is only about 1,000 strong, though 
                it numbered as many as 15,000 in pre-Castro days. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">"Some reports put it 
                as low as 800, some reports put it as much as 1,500. But the community 
                has gone through some very difficult times because there is not 
                enough to support synagogues and community life," he said. "In 
                Cuba, religious life is very much discouraged, to say the least." 
                </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">There is no rabbi or 
                Jewish school. There are just three synagogues in Havana and one 
                kosher butcher. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">However, with the collapse 
                of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of communism, Mr. Castro has 
                had to find new economic and political relationships. In this 
                effort, he has eased up on strictures concerning religious worship 
                and even attended a cultural evening last year at one of Havana's 
                remaining synagogues. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Many Cuban Jews are 
                descendants of Polish and Russian Jews who fled pogroms at the 
                turn of the century. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">That Cuba, Israel and 
                Canada have come to together to allow Jews to leave for Israel 
                is powerfully ironic. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">In the spring of 1939, 
                the St. Louis, a German ship carrying about 1,130 Jewish refugees, 
                was turned away by Havana authorities who did not recognize the 
                refugees' visas. Only 23 passengers were allowed to land in Havana. 
                </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Subsequently, Canada's 
                Mackenzie King government also turned the ship away, forcing it 
                to return to Europe. Most of the Jewish refugees were admitted 
                to the Netherlands, Belgium and France. But war broke out, Germany 
                occupied those countries and the Jews of the St. Louis were rounded 
                up and sent to gas chambers. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Many Jews left Cuba 
                after the 1959 revolution, when Mr. Castro turned toward communism 
                and their businesses were nationalized or expropriated. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">"Everybody left for 
                Miami," Mr. Karas said.</font></p>
