              <p> HAVANA - Birds enter through the synagogue's broken windows 
                and leave their droppings on the faded velvet seats. During religious 
                services, most of the sparse crowd sits in the first two rows 
                to be near four buzzing fans that push hot air through the suffocating 
                building. 
              <p> Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement that is the most sacred of 
                the Jewish holidays, will be celebrated all over the world today 
                with marathon services and solemn abstinence, including a daylong 
                fast. But deprivation is constant for Havana's once-thriving Jewish 
                community, which is fighting back from near extinction after 37 
                years of the Cuban revolution. 
              <p> In the 1950s, there were 15,000 Cuban Jews - shoemakers and 
                bankers, doctors and architects from families who left Europe 
                in the early 1900s. Almost the entire community picked up for 
                Miami and Israel when Fidel Castro's Communist government began 
                seizing businesses in the 1960s. 
              <p> Today, there are no more than 1,500 Jews in Cuba, many in their 
                60s and 70s. At sundown last night, wearing tattered prayer shawls 
                and faded black skullcaps, a handful of them straggled into the 
                enormous Temple Beth Shalom to begin Yom Kippur services conducted 
                by a 24- year-old rabbinical student flown in from Israel by the 
                American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. 
              <p> ``We can't afford to pay a full-time rabbi,'' said Lev Maya, 
                a 22-year-old graphic design student who is working to involve 
                Jewish youth in the community. 
              <p> ``The synagogue is a metaphor for the country,'' said Howard 
                M. Shaw, a semiretired Yarmouth dentist who spends most Jewish 
                holidays in Cuba. 
              <p> Built in 1957, Temple Beth Shalom takes up nearly half a block 
                near downtown Havana. Once the hub of most Jewish activity in 
                Cuba, it is now part of Havana's grand decay, an example of communities 
                fractured and nearly destroyed by the revolution. Half the building 
                was sold to the government after the Jewish exodus. 
              <p> Downstairs, in a large basement, members of the community gather 
                after Sabbath services for a Saturday afternoon meal. Some of 
                the food is left over from donations received for Passover, a 
                spring holiday. 
              <p> ``The Jewish holidays here, maybe because they've lost their 
                rabbis, there's a different feeling,'' said Shaw, who is a member 
                the Cape Cod Synagogue in Hyannis. ``In the States, there's a 
                little bit of fear and trepidation and excitement. People are 
                reviewing their sins of the past year, thinking of the future. 
                It's at a higher level. Here, things are so depressed, you don't 
                get that feeling. People are just surviving.'' 
              <p> By the late 1980s, according to Alberto Mechulam, ``we had probably 
                lost two generations of Jews here.'' Services were attended by 
                five or 10 elderly people. There were about 20 students enrolled 
                in a Hebrew school that lacked pencils, paper and books. 
              <p> Mechulam and others say that the community is coming back slowly. 
                Hebrew school enrollment has increased to 120 students. The community 
                receives assistance from the Canadian Embassy, which represents 
                Israel in Cuba, and the American Joint Jewish Distribution Committee, 
                which works to protect and strengthen Jewish communities abroad. 
              <p> ``The idea is to strengthen the community so that it can stand 
                by itself,'' said Roberto Senderowitsch, an Argentinian who coordinates 
                the committee's programs in Cuba. The programs include everything 
                from the distribution of cooking oil to the organization of religious 
                education. 
              <p> ``It was a community that was almost dead, but now it's beginning 
                to flourish again,'' said Maya, the graphic arts student. He conducted 
                the Sabbath services Saturday under the guidance of Adrian Herbst, 
                a rabbinal student who is teaching others to perform holiday services 
                after he returns to Israel. 
              <p> Maya said he now goes door-to-door in the community hoping to 
                recruit not only Jewish children but their parents, many of whom 
                abandoned Judaism because of religious persecution. ``There's 
                more young people,'' he said. ``There's more spirit. It's coming 
                alive again.''
