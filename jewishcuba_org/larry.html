                dead in the crushed guinea grass, but she seemed so young and 
                unharmed. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> It is November 
                or December of 1958. I am with Company Six, Column One, in late 
                1958. Company Six is led by Orlando Rodriguez Puerta and Column 
                One is Castro's own column. We are winning on the plains of the 
                Cauto, the forces of Cuban Dictator Batista are hiding out in 
                their strong places fearing our attacks. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> We are in 
                a large pasture by the Central highway, just west of Contramaestre 
                or is it Jiguani. We are a little west of where an overpass makes 
                a dogleg to the north. The road is about 150 yards away, a two-lane 
                ribbon of black asphalt going east-west. A barbwire cattle fence 
                separates the highway from the field. The low bush and short grass 
                of an overgrazed pasture is spread below, in front of us, between 
                us and the road. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Beyond the 
                road to the north is a mixed savanna of tall trees, swamps and 
                pasture extending further northward to the horizon line. To our 
                right the road curves north, goes over the over pass, over the 
                railroad, and then returns running to the east. The height of 
                the overpass, sitting on skinny concrete pillars, blocks most 
                of our view to the east-northeast. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> We are on 
                a slight rise about 150 yards south of the highway. The rise is 
                covered with short bushy, saplings among higher trees. We stop 
                to set up an ambush. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> I am terrified 
                because if tanks came down the highway there is nothing we have, 
                no weapon, that can stop them, and there is nowhere to run. So 
                I take up one of the shovels and began to dig a short narrow slot 
                trench. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> First the 
                others laugh and make remarks, but I keep on digging. Then the 
                others begin to look around and think. They look and they think. 
                Then one of them says: "It's my turn with the shovel." </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> I do not 
                get a chance with any of the shovels the rest of that day. After 
                a while the rise is covered with foxholes and short trenches. 
                Still unhappy about security I cut the droopy leafed saplings 
                and place them around my trench. The idea catches on. That is 
                fine that day; it looked green. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Next day 
                the leaves have wilted in the hot sun. I am walking on the road, 
                the Central Highway, walking alone along the empty, empty road, 
                scouting something or other. I am distracted by some vague thought, 
                I do not listen, I daydream. An avioneta, a machine-gun-carrying 
                spotter plane, comes out from behind some trees and flies towards 
                me. I have no where to go. I am in the open. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The avioneta 
                makes one pass. I fire my accurate Springfield 30.06 that I had 
                swapped for my San Christobal after Guisa. If the avioneta gets 
                its machinegun going I am lost, there is no cover. My mind in 
                its panic disassociates fear from fight; a strange focused calm 
                comes over me. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> I try to 
                make every one of my rifle's slow fire count. I must make every 
                accurate, powerful round count, every shot absolutely, perfectly, 
                aimed. I fire one plane length ahead. I fire once, twice, perhaps 
                three times. I must have hit something, because the avioneta breaks 
                out from its run and suddenly climbs high. Happy in false triumph, 
                I too am a fool; the spotter plane now knows that we rebels are 
                near. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Time passes. 
                I return to the ambush. A man comes across the field. He looked 
                familiar, but I was not sure. We stop him. He gives a cock and 
                bull story about crossing the field. We do not believe him. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Then somebody 
                else recognizes him, he is Jacinto the barefoot spy who had escaped 
                from Las Pe&ntilde;as. I say nothing, not wanting to see him shot 
                right there. It is too late, somebody else recognizes him; mercifully, 
                Jacinto is not shot there, he is taken to headquarters. His escape 
                from Las Pe&ntilde;as has only given him six more months of life. 
                </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> There are 
                three gunners, just nondescript short, and brown. Their hair is 
                black and straight, their faces too young, or with too much Taino, 
                to grow a beard. They are just boys, perhaps seventeen, yet they 
                are charged with the machine gun. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> They, the 
                machine gunners, sit on the rise south of the central, their red 
                bandanas around their necks, and set up their 30.06 air-cooled, 
                belt-fed, Browning on its tripod. A black metal box, a heavy air 
                cooled barrel, sits on three wide spread low legs; it is set up 
                right in the open. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> I ask them 
                about their red bandanas; they say it is to honor the African 
                gods. I am not sure they tell the truth, for their skins are not 
                dark enough for Africa. They are from Manzanillo, the first home 
                of the communists in Cuba. Does red mean red? I do not know. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Much to 
                my horror, Captain Puerta tells a few of us, me included, that 
                we are to give the machine-gunners rifle support. We the supporting 
                rifle men are to share the hostile fire that the machine gunners 
                stupidity and lack of stealth will surely bring. We do not like 
                it, but say nothing, it is an order. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> We dig in 
                even further; the machine gunners do not. I suggested as tactfully 
                as I could that they should perhaps dig in. One of them replies 
                "When you are going to die you are going to die," something that 
                even then I recognize as a sophism of the worst sort. They, just 
                boys, are obviously marked for death. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> We watch 
                the machine-gunners a while. In the heat of plains of the Cauto 
                the midday waves of shimmering heated air ripple above the black 
                perforate cooling jacket of the machine gun barrel. The metal 
                of the machine gun is almost too hot to touch. The rippling air 
                floats over the machine gunners heads, above their red bandanas. 
                The hot air ripples are as if specters, as if ghosts, laughing 
                at a coming foolish death, are laughing at fools ready to join 
                them. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> We again 
                hope they will dig in; the machine gunners do not. So then, to 
                protect our lives, we the rifle men discretely and quietly move 
                our positions as far away from them as possible and dig in even 
                deeper. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> We know 
                violent death. We have been escopeteros. We know from Braulio 
                Coroneau's death at Guisa that the machine gunners will be a magnet 
                for enemy fire. If the enemy tries to force its way west on the 
                Central highway we will fail, because the machine gunners are 
                not dug in. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The Casquitos 
                have plenty of fire power, most have San Christobal automatic 
                long range carbines, and many more machine guns of their own. 
                Soon after first contact, our machine gunners will be dead and 
                with their deaths, we will lose the support of the machine gun. 
                </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The three 
                fates measure the end of the machine gunners lives. Atropos the 
                mother of atropine will soon widen their eyes, she the giver of 
                death prepares to snip the thread of their lives. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The machine 
                gunners lives are not only their business. The gunners stupidity 
                affects us all. We know then that outflanked we will have to retreat 
                across open country taking losses. Those idiots are going to kill 
                us all. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> We begin 
                to break the mental bonds that hold us together, we hate those 
                stupid machine gunners. That hate feels good; if we hate them 
                their deaths will bother us less. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> We hear 
                firing to the east-north-east. We cannot see anything. The overpass 
                blocks the view. A runner comes up breathless giving orders to 
                bring up the machine gun to the point of contact. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Fearing 
                the contagion of the self-doomed machine gunners, I ask if that 
                is an order for general support or just for the machine gun. The 
                runner, to my great relief, says just the machine gun. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The Casquitos, 
                the helmeted ones, the Batista soldiers, our enemies, make their 
                move out of Jiguani or Contramaestre. They are trying to cross 
                the plain beyond the swamp to the north of the Central trying 
                to reach Bayamo. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The Casquitos 
                are moving west in the opposite direction on a similar route to 
                that successfully taken by Spanish General Escario in 1898. In 
                that ancient year, my ancestors hurt the Spanish but did not stop 
                them. The Spanish took losses, were delayed for a few critical 
                days, but kept on going east to try to relieve Santiago. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The Spanish 
                are ancient history, our war is now. The firing to the east-northeast 
                is intense. We can hear the individual rifle shots, and the deadly 
                rhumpty rhumpty rhumpty rhythm of the fast automatic fire from 
                the San Christobals. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The machine 
                gunners follow the runner and are soon out of sight. Firing becames 
                more, and more intense, the San Christobal fire bursts grow together 
                with the MI rifle fire and the heavy beat of the machine guns. 
                All that sound rises even louder and faster mixing the individual 
                weapons sound to a now indistinguishable sustained deafening roar. 
                Then the individual bursts are heard again, they slackened and 
                become sporadic. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Later we 
                find out that the self-doomed machine gunners had placed their 
                weapon too close to the small, white, concrete block structure, 
                perhaps an irrigation pump house where the Casquitos were anchoring 
                their positions. The machine gunners had not pulled back to find 
                a position from which they could sustain killing fire. Instead 
                the poor doomed boys, unwise to the end, lay firing in the open 
                field and very soon two of them are dead, belly wounded somehow 
                by ground grazing bullets. The third gunner pulls a John Wayne 
                and runs firing the machine gun, burning his hands on the overheated 
                gun barrel, but surviving. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The idiocy 
                of the machine gunners gives the Casquitos a chance. The Casquitos 
                take it and run. They are in trucks; we are on foot; they get 
                away. They are going west north of our ambush site. They are moving 
                fast on the firm soil of the pastures north of the swamp. We cannot 
                stop them. The Casquitos, now free from accurate fire from the 
                machine gun, continued to the west over plains towards Bayamo. 
                The self-doomed machine gunners die for nothing. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> We all rise 
                and go north across the highway in lost pursuit, in failed attempt 
                to cut off the Casquitos. We hear the exchange of fire of the 
                pursued and the pursuers. The Casquitos, having killed our machine 
                gunners, are now moving fast further to the north of us. Then 
                we hear the gunfire change direction as they try to escape to 
                the north west. We, are further west, and must try to cut the 
                Batista forces off by crossing the Central, and going due north. 
                </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> One thing 
                the Batista planes did well was to make us take cover. The first 
                low whine of the armed spotter planes or the much heavier drone 
                of the B-26s makes us seek shelter to hide; and thus the noise 
                the planes passing over was sufficient to immobilize us. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Our greatest 
                terror is to be caught in the middle of a great pasture far from 
                trees or bushes. There, caught the feared open country, our only 
                recourse is to stand straight up. So very straight up, by the 
                fences pretending to be a fence post, or worse far from the fence 
                to roll up in a ball and pretend to be a boulder. Here we, we 
                are lucky, we have the great trees of the plains of Cuba to hide 
                behind. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> We cannot 
                move forward when the planes begin firing. The best we can do 
                is take shelter. We are so lucky to be by large trees. We walk 
                around to the bullet shade--the otherside- of the great tree trunks-- 
                as the planes circles and shoots at us. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> It is a 
                matter of honor not to push others out of the way, to avoid the 
                error of making it a kind of potentially lethal game of musical 
                chairs, each vying and pushing to get the most protected spot. 
                Such a game would have soon attracted the lethal attention of 
                those keen-eyed pilots and gunners selected for their excellent 
                vision. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Airplane 
                attacks warn the Casquitos to be ready for us, and in the case 
                of the sugar mill Central America this will allow the Batista 
                soldiers, the "Casquitos," to ambush us and cause us a number 
                of casualties. Here on plains of the Cauto near Santa Rita the 
                two B-26 strafing our group do not allow us to block the escape 
                of a convoy the Casquitos. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The pair 
                of B-26 fighter bombers delay us, their fire is withering, they 
                normally have eight fifty caliber machine guns. Rafaelito my cousin 
                the pilot, says they only had four. We did not count. The bursts 
                of fifty caliber fire boom like thunder. I spend time circling 
                around a giant spreading tree; it was not a raintree, the algarobbo, 
                for it had smooth bark, it must have been some kind of ficus. 
                What ever it was it could stop 0.50 calibre bullets. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> We do not 
                panic. We are safe; the planes, having expended their ammunition, 
                leave their job done. We have been kept pinned down for a while. 
                None of us are hit. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> As our ears 
                recover we hear the lessening drone of the planes going away returning 
                to base. The sky is now quiet. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> We continue 
                north and try to cross a swampy area of head high cortadera, razor 
                edged, saw grass. I and two others are sent ahead, but we cannot 
                locate the heavy incoming fire that is all around us, coming from 
                the north, chopping down the grass. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> I and my 
                two friends do not fire; that would give our position away. We 
                cannot stay there in the grass; the bullets will eventually find 
                us. With some speed, we withdraw, report the situation and wait 
                behind cover. There is nothing more we can do. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Later things 
                calmed down, no more shooting, the Casquito's trucks cannot be 
                heard to the west. We follow the tracks of the trucks, south of 
                the endless fence line, gathering whatever ammunition the Casquitos 
                have dropped. We watched the bleeding, wounded, giant, white, 
                Charolais cattle grazing. Thin streams of red blood spurts from 
                their vast white sides, yet they continue to graze, heads bent 
                to the ground. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> At the end 
                of some miles I smell fire, not grass or timber burning, but the 
                residue of an oily, smelly, fire. I look on the ground to find 
                truck tire tracks turning a little south. We turn a maybe a hundred 
                yards south, find a broken down flatbed truck, a pile of deliberately 
                burnt, twisted rifles and the woman. I still see her in my dreams, 
                and still don't know who she was, and why the Casquitos left her 
                there. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> She lay 
                dead in the crushed guinea grass, but she seems so young and unharmed. 
                She is an ordinary woman not strikingly beautiful, nor ugly, her 
                hair is dark, her face unlined. Her body is slim, her breasts 
                and hips normal, feminine, and ordinary. Her calf length dark 
                dress covering her with modesty is flared out as if she is running. 
                One shoe, a city woman's pump, has fallen off. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Who is she? 
                Who was she? Was she a noncommissioned officer's daughter, a soldier's 
                wife, a generous camp follower enjoying unrestrained the burning 
                passions of ardent young soldiers? Was she an informer who must 
                leave with the Casquitos or face death at the hands of the relatives 
                of the betrayed, or a hard working prostitute servicing tens of 
                soldiers a night? I do not know, it does not matter, she is dead. 
                </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> I look closer 
                and then see the seemingly insignificant entry wound, a mere red 
                spot, no spilled blood. The bullet had penetrated through her 
                left arm at shoulder level, a place left bare and vulnerable by 
                the straps of her dress. There is no exit wound. The bullet must 
                have spent its energies severing her arteries, ripping inside 
                her chest, killing her. Death must have come fast and merciful. 
                </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> I look at 
                the wigwam-shaped pile of fire-destroyed, twisted, Springfield 
                30-06 rifles. Although the rifles are intact, none seemed useful 
                and I think the bolts are gone. The Casquitos must have had time 
                to set them on fire and destroy them. Perhaps our Asturian armorer 
                machinist from "El Sordo" could do something with them. </font>
