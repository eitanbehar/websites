                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Ask Miriam 
                  Saul to talk about Cuba and she leans forward in her seat, speaking 
                  with excitement as she tries to impart every detail of the island 
                  country's beauty, the warmth of its people and the struggles 
                  of its Jewish community. </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Saul will 
                  travel to Cuba in June -- her fourth trip there in less than 
                  two years -- as part of the International Community Builders 
                  program of the Marcus Jewish Community Center of Atlanta (MJCCA). 
                  About 20 Jewish Atlantans will travel with Saul, bringing relief 
                  supplies for Cuba's Jewish community of some 1,500 people. </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The group 
                  will follow in the footsteps of former president Jimmy Carter, 
                  scheduled to visit Cuba in mid-May. Carter's trip, approved 
                  by the Bush administration, would be the first by a U.S. president 
                  or former president since the 1959 revolution when Fidel Castro 
                  took power. </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> For Saul, 
                  aiding Cuban Jewry is personal. She was born in Cuba and grew 
                  up in the small town of Matanzas. In 1961, Saul's parents, Zhenia 
                  and Ben Greszes, sent Saul, then 11, and her older sister, Lydia, 
                  to Atlanta to live with relatives. When Saul left, she didn't 
                  expect to see her parents again. "We thought we were saying 
                  goodbye forever," she said. The Greszes eventually reunited 
                  with their children in Atlanta and still live here. Saul soaked 
                  up American culture and learned to fit in, but, she said, "I 
                  always felt as if something was missing in me." </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> In 2000, 
                  as she approached her 50th birthday, Saul decided to seek government 
                  permission to visit Cuba. What began that December as a personal 
                  journey became a fierce determination to help Cuba's small Jewish 
                  community. Saul said she was moved by Cuban Jews' dedication 
                  to nourishing their heritage despite the nation's overwhelming 
                  poverty, the limited opportunities for Jewish education and 
                  the restrictions of a Communist society that frowns on organized 
                  religion. </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> No rabbi 
                  serves in Cuba. A retired physician, Jose Miller, heads Havana's 
                  Jewish community. The Joint Distribution Committee, a United 
                  Jewish Communities relief organization, assigns a Jewish couple 
                  to live in Havana and visit Cuba's smaller Jewish communities 
                  to help organize religious observances. Those communities are 
                  using Torahs and other religious artifacts that were stored 
                  in Havana since the 1960s and are now making their way back 
                  to their original communities. </font>
                <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"It's 
                  like the purest kind of Judaism, seeing how they are practicing," 
                  Saul said. "It is a miracle that out of nothing, they have made 
                  this community flourish." </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> After 
                  her first trip, Saul began to look for ways to help Cuba's Jews 
                  and soon became a one-woman clearinghouse for medicines, powdered 
                  milk and Judaica. At Greenfield Hebrew Academy, where she teaches 
                  kindergarten, Saul asked students to give her their used school 
                  supplies at the end of the 2001 school year, knowing what were 
                  worn-out crayons to these students would be treasures in Cuba. 
                  "It is a place where so little can go so far," she said. </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Saul carried 
                  the supplies on her second trip to Cuba in June 2001; American 
                  embargoes prohibit shipping anything to Cuba, so supplies must 
                  be hand-carried. </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Saul quickly 
                  realized she needed to find a support system if she was to make 
                  a significant impact, so she became involved with several American 
                  organizations that help Cuban Jewry. Then, she learned about 
                  MJCCA's International Community Builders program, a vision of 
                  the center's volunteer/community services coordinator, Shaindle 
                  Schmuckler. </font>
                <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"I wanted 
                  to affect another community with all the wealth we have here," 
                  said Schmuckler, who said she is referring to resources as well 
                  as money. <a href="http://www.ghacademy.org/cubaproject/" target="_blank"><img src="wagner3.jpg" width="294" height="221" align="right" vspace="6" hspace="6" border="0"></a>During 
                  this school year, Saul has involved Hebrew Academy second-graders 
                  with Cuban Jewry as a tzedaka project. They have collected money, 
                  clothing and medicine and have learned about the island. Saul 
                  delivered the first batch of the students' donations in December, 
                  but she said the students continuously ask her what they can 
                  do next for Cuba's Jews. </font> 
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> A December 
                  2001 trip had been planned as the inaugural International Community 
                  Builders mission to Cuba, but it was postponed after the Sept. 
                  11 terrorist attacks. Saul went anyway -- she refused to miss 
                  the bar mitzvah of David Farrin, only the fourth bar mitzvah 
                  since 1960 in Santiago de Cuba. </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Saul said 
                  she marvels at the drive the boy must have had to study, and 
                  the way the community, which has no rabbi, found a way to teach 
                  him. "They just re-gained the building that used to be the city's 
                  synagogue," she said. </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The MJCCA 
                  mission to Cuba has been rescheduled for June, but Saul said 
                  she plans to go a week early with her husband, Daniel, and their 
                  children, Jamie, 20, and 17-year-old twins Courtney and Marshall 
                  to show her family where she grew up. </font>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Saul said 
                  her thoughts are with her Cuban peers daily and her garage is 
                  a storehouse of donated toiletries, baby food and clothing that 
                  she will take on her next trip. On previous trips, she has taken 
                  menorahs, mezzuzot, challah covers and tzedaka boxes. The are 
                  no restrictions on what can be brought; travelers are limited 
                  only by a per-pound fee. Saul said she believes she was destined 
                  to help Cuba's Jews. </font>
