              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> If you have visited Havana in the 
                last 34 years, you certainly know Coppelia. For those of you who 
                have not done so yet, but are certainly planning to, Coppelia 
                is an ice cream parlour located in the very heart of the new city, 
                in Vedado, across the street from what was once the Havana Hilton, 
                later on the Havana Libre and now the Havana Libre Tryp. <br>
                </font><font face="Arial" size="-1"><br>
                </font>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Coppelia is not just any old ice 
                cream place, it is THE ice cream parlour, and since the Strawberry 
                and Chocolate film, better known as the ice cream Cathedral. According 
                to original plans, it would offer 28 different flavours and unending 
                variations with: fruits and/or syrups, cake, cookies, blended, 
                with nuts….but life’s realities have greatly curtailed its offerings. 
                Another change is that they now offer other ice cream brands, 
                but I would suggest you try their own, even at the risk to your 
                cholesterol of its 14 % milk fat contents, it is worth it, and 
                what are vacations for if not to take high risks. <br>

                </font>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> A few days ago, a friend invited 
                me to Coppelia (luckily I am not fond of ice cream, I am overweight 
                enough) but he is, so I accepted. It was a nice afternoon,. When 
                we arrived it had just stopped raining, a real tropical downpour, 
                so there were not the usual lines and we even got a table to ourselves, 
                which is really incredible. My friend was somewhat downcast, which 
                is not his style and finally told me that his son had just emigrated 
                to Israel. <br>
                </font><font face="Arial" size="-1"><br>
                </font>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Now, my friend is not Jewish, but 
                his wife is. They have been happily (I think) married for many 
                years and have two children, the son who went to Israel and a 
                daughter who works as an Engineer for a successful Cuban corporation. 
                Luckily for my friend’s wife things had changed a lot in the Jewish 
                community by the time she married, so she avoided the destiny 
                of Sima, a young girl whose orthodox father had her murdered to 
                stop her from entering a mixed marriage. But that was way back 
                in the late 30s, early 40s, when the Hebrew community was large 
                and strong. <br>
                </font><font face="Arial" size="-1"><br>
                </font>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> The first Jews to come to the Americas 
                came in the same boat with Christopher Columbus (Luis de Torres, 
                shortly before baptised in Spain), some settled in Cuba towards 
                the end of the XIX Century. In spite of their practising the Catholic 
                faith, the hand of the inquisition still reached for them. The 
                first trial of the Inquisition in Havana was against a Jew, Francisco 
                Gomez de Leon, executed in Cartagena, after, of course, confiscating 
                his large fortune, which without doubt was the cause of his persecution. 
                <br>
                </font><font face="Arial" size="-1"><br>
                </font>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> However, others fared better, and 
                by bribing the proper authorities, were able to settle in peace 
                and even prosper. Their contribution is not to be ignored, they 
                were instrumental in bringing to the island what would constitute 
                the main source of revenue until the middle of the XX Century: 
                the sugar cane. Jews brought the sugar cane from Madeira to Brazil 
                and from there to the Antilles. They were also the inventors of 
                growing tobacco under a cloth, to protect it from the sun and 
                wind. The system is still used today to produce the best and most 
                expensive tobacco leaves in the world. Tobacco continues to be 
                an important industry for the country. <br>
                </font><font face="Arial" size="-1"><br>
                </font>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> The large Jewish migration occurred 
                between 1910 – 1920. They came from Europe, trying to enter the 
                US, which at the time had a very strict quota system, so they 
                landed here, as a stop over. Then, according to Salim Tache Jalak, 
                a member of the orthodox congregation belonging to the Adath Israel 
                synagogue, they found here “the only land in the world in which 
                there is no anti-Semitism”, a good climate, a friendly people, 
                so many decided to stay and settle. <br>
                </font><font face="Arial" size="-1"><br>
                </font>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> And settle they did, and many prospered, 
                of course, in the garment industry. I remember, as a child, walking 
                down Muralla Street in old Havana. Muralla, in case you are one 
                of the few Canadians or Americans who do not speak Spanish yet, 
                means Wall, but this was quite a different Wall Street. This was 
                no financial emporium but a street completely lined with shops, 
                each doorway a shop, most of them owned by Jews. Materials and 
                ready made clothes were the main offerings. The owners, or sales 
                clerks, would stand on the sidewalk announcing their wares to 
                the passers by, and dragging you in by the arm, to offer the “greatest 
                bargain, the latest fashion” and they did offer good prices for 
                quality goods. <br>
                </font><font face="Arial" size="-1"><br>
                </font>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> For some reason or another, Cubans 
                decided to call Jews, Poles (Polacos). I’ve always thought there 
                must have been an important Polish-Jewish migration at some time, 
                but if that was the case, nobody knows about it. And the funny 
                part is that anybody with a non-English accent became a Polaco, 
                this included Germans, French, Hungarians, Turks, etc. Jewish 
                or not, they were all Polacos, and all equally accepted. As all 
                Spaniards were Gallegos, whether they came from Galitzia or Barcelona. 
                <br>
                </font><font face="Arial" size="-1"><br>
                </font>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> The very wealthy did discriminate 
                against Jews, as they did against the poor, blacks, Chinese or 
                anybody of mixed parentage, the latter constituted at the time 
                somewhere around 40 % of the population of Cuba. <br>
                </font><font face="Arial" size="-1"><br>
                </font>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> What this meant was that Jews were 
                limited to attending the poor man’s Club: Casino Deportivo de 
                La Habana. Clubs were very important to the resident of Havana. 
                It was not only a place of social life and activities, but also 
                the only easy access to beaches, or swimming pools, a dire need 
                in our long hot summer. <br>
                </font><font face="Arial" size="-1"><br>
                </font>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> The owner of the Casino Deportivo 
                de La Habana, Alfredo Hornedo, an unsavoury Cuban politician, 
                was originally the owner of a newspaper, El Pais, and later on 
                a Theatre, which included an ice skating rink, named Blanquita, 
                after his first wife, and later on renamed Karl Marx and a Hotel, 
                Rosita, named after his second wife, much visited by the mob, 
                later on renamed Sierra Maestra and now being refurbished <br>
                </font><font face="Arial" size="-1"><br>
                </font>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> As his was not an exclusive club, 
                and required of no large initial fee, some working class Cubans 
                were members. I remember on Saturdays and Sundays the large Jewish 
                membership, which kept very much apart, they did not want their 
                girls and boys to fall in love with non Jews, and also because 
                in many instances they carried their kosher lunch. The only members 
                allowed to bring in food, the rest were expected to attend either 
                the restaurant, cafeteria or bar managed by the Club. <br>
                </font><font face="Arial" size="-1"><br>
                </font>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> After the revolution these clubs 
                were turned over to the different unions but for lack of adequate 
                maintenance, some collapsed, some are closed and others are still 
                open to the public at large. But they do seem to be en route to 
                disappearing in the near future as they are located in an area 
                in which a lot of real state development is going on. One of the 
                most luxurious, which catered to the very wealthy and exclusive 
                society, the Havana Biltmore, has just been beautifully refurbished 
                and turned into the Havana Club, catering to foreign business 
                men and diplomats residing in Havana. It is also open to tourist. 
                Cubans come in as guests. <br>
                </font><font face="Arial" size="-1"><br>
                </font>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> But coming back to the Jewish presence 
                in Cuba. Their number swelled to around 15,000 in Havana, with 
                smaller communities (around a 100 each) in Santiago de Cuba, Camaguey 
                and Cienfuegos. In Havana at the time there were 5 Synagogues, 
                most of them orthodox, a Kosher restaurant, Moishe Pipik, and 
                resident rabbis <br>
                </font><font face="Arial" size="-1"><br>
                </font>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Trying to find what was left of 
                this large community, I went to Old Havana, where it had been 
                originally established. What I found was a small group of people, 
                mostly pensioners, whose life evolves around the Adath Israel 
                Synagogue. They explained that in the early sixties, with the 
                policy of nationalising all business, big and small, the Jewish 
                community together with other businessmen, fled to the US, which 
                finally opened its arms to it. <br>
                </font><font face="Arial" size="-1"><br>
                </font>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Now about my friend’s son, neither 
                the mother, nor the daughter, and certainly not my friend, are 
                religious, but the son, like many young people of different faiths 
                in Cuba, made the decision of studying and practising his religion. 
                And now, like many other young Cubans, he decided to emigrate. 
                Of course, emigration is nothing new to the Jewish people or to 
                the Cubans for that matter. <br>
                </font><font face="Arial" size="-1"><br>
                </font>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> The community now numbers around 
                1500 members.. They maintain their temples and traditions mostly 
                thanks to donations from other wealthy communities. They are not 
                able to support a resident rabbi, so marriages and Bar Mitzvah 
                must wait for a visitor. I could not find anybody who spoke even 
                Yiddish. Some read Hebrew but only know the sounds, not the meaning 
                of the words. <br>
                </font><font face="Arial" size="-1"><br>
                </font>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> In the last 5 years, roughly 400 
                Jews, male and female, young and old, in families or alone, have 
                emigrated to Israel. Others are preparing to follow suit, but 
                some of the old ones, like those I found in Old Havana, are happy 
                to stay. <br>
                </font><font face="Arial" size="-1"><br>
                </font>
              <p> <font face="Arial" size="-1">“I have travelled to other countries 
                in Latin America”, said one of them, “and have seen synagogues 
                bombed. In Mexico, they frisk foreigners before letting them enter 
                the temple, because there have been bomb threats and other acts 
                of violence and Israel is a battle field. Only in Cuba have we 
                always been allowed to practice our religion in peace. <br>
                </font><font face="Arial" size="-1"><br>
                </font>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> The only time in their history 
                in Cuba in which they experienced violence against them or their 
                temples was during the Gulf War, when Arab students hurled stones 
                at the windows of the Adath Israel Synagogue. But the police put 
                an end to it very quickly, and except for some glass broken, no 
                other damage was made, and nobody was hurt. <br>
                </font><font face="Arial" size="-1"><br>
                </font>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> The Cuban Jewish community had 
                a short history, but it made important contributions in all fields 
                of life: social, cultural, political, economic: relevant university 
                professors, writers, journalists, painters and sculptors, film 
                makers, musicians, important party figures. Unfortunately it is 
                now disappearing. <br>
