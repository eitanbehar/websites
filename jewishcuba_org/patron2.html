                    <p>HAVANA – Many of those in Havana's main synagogue had traveled 
                      for hours to get there. In crowded buses the Cubans came 
                      from Santiago, Camaguey and Santa Clara. In small charter 
                      planes Americans flew in from Baltimore, New York and Washington. 
                      From Chile, Argentina, and Mexico, Latin American Jewish 
                      leaders had also come. As they all witnessed the torahs 
                      being brought into Havana's newly renovated Patronato synagogue, 
                      there were tears of joy and many smiles. For many years, 
                      this moment had only been a dream. A dream that has now 
                      come true.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Jose Miller, long-time leader of Cuba's Jewish community, 
                      stood proudly at the refurbished pulpit as he addressed 
                      the many Cuban, Latin American and North American Jewish 
                      leaders who had made their way to Havana for the rededication 
                      ceremony. "My friends, this synagogue and community center 
                      were first opened in 1953. Much has happened since then. 
                      This day, represents a new beginning for the Patronato. 
                      Today, we celebrate not only the renovation of a building, 
                      but the revival of a community. We are so happy to share 
                      this new beginning with our Jewish brothers and sisters 
                      everywhere."</p>

                    <p>The rededication of the synagogue and community center 
                      is being recognized as a milestone in the Jewish history 
                      of Cuba – a Jewish history that is both rich and largely 
                      unknown in the West. 
                    <p> Adele Dworin, the unofficial historian of Havana's Jewish 
                      community could not stop smiling. "When I was a little girl 
                      here in Havana, there was a strong Jewish community. Then, 
                      it all stopped, almost completely. Ten years ago, I was 
                      the youngest person working in the Patronato – and I was 
                      not young. Today," she giggles, "I am one of the oldest. 
                      So many young people are coming back. Isn't that wonderful?"</p>
                    <p>At one time, Cuba's Jewish community was the most prosperous 
                      in the Latin American world. Cuba played host to a large 
                      number of Jewish Americans who visited the island regularly 
                      and even formed burial societies with plots secured in Havana's 
                      Jewish cemetery.</p>
                    <p>Things changed overnight during the 1959 Revolution, as 
                      almost 90% of Cuban Jewry fled their homeland. The overwhelming 
                      majority of Cuban Jews who remained assimilated almost totally. 
                    </p>
                    <p>In 1992, in the wake of the disintegration of the Soviet 
                      Union, the Communist Congress of Cuba announced that Cubans 
                      could be religiously involved and still remain members in 
                      good standing of the Communist party. Eliminating the stigma 
                      of visible religious identification and expression was a 
                      crucial element in creating an environment hospitable to 
                      Jewish renewal. </p>

                    <p>Ivan Glait, JDC's Program Manager in Cuba, recalls with 
                      a smile, what it was like for those Jews who practiced their 
                      religion throughout. "When they had seven people and three 
                      torahs in a room, this was recognized as a ‘Cuban <i>minyan</i>!'" 
                      Glait and his wife Cynthia are responsible for overseeing 
                      the activities of every Jewish community in Cuba. He says 
                      the hard work of the communities across the island is producing 
                      results. "Big moments like this rededication are wonderful," 
                      he said. "Another big moment will come this summer when 
                      a young Jewish couple will become the first to be married 
                      in the newly refurbished Patronato. They met through Jewish 
                      community service at the synagogue. Now they will be married 
                      here."</p>
                    <p>The road to revival has not been easy. Even though the 
                      opportunity for revival had been created, the Jews of Cuba 
                      had undergone two generations of cultural amnesia. Little 
                      knowledge or resources necessary for rebuilding Jewish life 
                      existed, on either the individual or communal level. </p>
                    <p>Dr. Miller reached out to the JDC in 1992 and asked for 
                      help in nurturing the spark of Jewish life that the few 
                      had kept alive. JDC enriched the Passover packages that 
                      were being allowed into Cuba as religious relief. The packages, 
                      sent from the offices of the Canadian Jewish Congress, contained 
                      matzot and other Passover items. Soon after, JDC began sending 
                      in shipments of pharmaceuticals. At this point, a free pharmacy 
                      opened in the Patronato. Jewish doctors started dispensing 
                      medicines to anyone who came in with a verifiable medical 
                      need. With this program and others like it, the pulse of 
                      the Patronato began beating stronger, once more.</p>
                    As they began returning, the Jews of Havana found that years 
                    of neglect had taken their toll on the Patronato. The elaborate 
                    woodwork of the main sanctuary had become riddled with termites. 
                    The roof consisted of a series of leaks and open holes. Birds 
                    nested in the rafters. All in all, it was a scene of abandonment. 
                    And yet, amidst the disrepair, the soul of the community shone 
                    brightly. Women's groups met in one corner of a large room, 
                    children's classes in the other, and the choir practiced prayers 
                    in the hallways. Argentinian Rabbi Shmuel Szteinhendler, who 
                    attended the rededication ceremony, remembers visiting Cuba 
                    regularly in the early 1990's to teach Jewish studies and 
                    lead the congregation in prayers. Even then, he said, the 
                    spirit of the Cuban Jews was strong. "When I first arrived 
                    I saw a homemade poster which read, <i>‘Am Yisrael B'Cuba 
                    Chai!</i>' [Long Live the Jewish Community of Cuba.!] I said 
                    to myself, this is my mission in Cuba. To help make this come 
                    true." 
                    <p><img src="pat6.jpg" border=2 align="left" width=250 height=178 alt=""  HSPACE="15%" VSPACE="10%">During 
                      the eight years since 1992, synagogues and community centers 
                      have been opened in towns across Cuba. A tide of cultural 
                      identification has been re-established, and Cuba is taking 
                      its rightful place among the Latin American Jewish community. 
                      Each summer, a Jewish youth camp hosted in Cuba attracts 
                      children from all over Central and South America. This summer, 
                      for the first time, Jewish children from the United States 
                      will also attend. As a community, Cuba's Jews now participate 
                      in a wide array of social service volunteer programs through 
                      their synagogues, including helping the elderly, providing 
                      supplemental medical care, teaching Hebrew and Jewish culture 
                      and offering Sabbath dinners.</p>
                    <p>"When I come back to my home community," Rabbi Szteinhendler 
                      remarked, "I see how we struggle to keep people from leaving 
                      the Jewish community. Here, in Cuba, they are struggling 
                      to join the Jewish community. What has happened here is 
                      a <i>mitzvah</i>. And you know, all of us who have helped 
                      should really thank the Cuban Jews for allowing us to perform 
                      this <i>mitzvah</i>. Because a <i>mitzvah</i> is a blessing 
                      for those who perform it."</p>
                    <p>At the start of the rededication ceremony, Dr. Miller nailed 
                      the mezuzah to the synagogue doorpost and recited the prayer. 
                      Then, as the people filed into the sanctuary for services, 
                      a parade of hands, young and old, reached out and touched 
                      the soft dark wood of the<i> mezuzah</i>, a symbol of their 
                      common past and the future they are building together.</p>
