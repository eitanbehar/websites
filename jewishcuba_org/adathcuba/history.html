        <blockquote>
          <div align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When Jews 
            from Russia and Poland started arriving in Havana after World War 
            I, the only Ashkenazi synagogue in the city was United Hebrew Congregation, 
            religiously very liberal with a well-to-do English-speaking membership. 
            It was hardly the place for Yiddish-speaking immigrants from Eastern 
            Europe to feel comfortable. </font>
            <p></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first step towards 
              the establishment of a synagogue for Eastern Europeans took place 
              in 1923, when an immigrant from Ponovesz, Lithuania, Ben Zion Sofer, 
              started a minyan in his apartment at Calle Paola No. 17 (bajos). 
              In 1925 that minyan developed into Congregaci&oacute;n Adath Israel, 
              on the second floor of Calle Jes&uacute;s Mar&iacute;a 103. The 
              facility was basic with no embellishments, but it served the purpose.</font></p>
            <p></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The majority of the Ashkenazi 
              immigrants to Cuba were not strictly observant. Adath Israel was 
              nominally Orthodox. Its prayer services were traditional, and it 
              officially stood for religious observance. </font></p>
            <p></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first rabbi of the 
              congregation was Zvi Kaplan (1864-1939). He had immigrated to Cuba 
              in 1928, following the advice of a friend that the Jewish Community 
              was looking to hire a rabbi; his family followed one year later. 
              Within a short while, however, a dispute broke out, and a group 
              headed by Kaplan bolted. In 1929 they founded Knesseth Israel, where 
              Kaplan remained rabbi until his death in 1939. Kaplan's son, Sender, 
              soon became the editor of Habaner Lebn, a Yiddish newspaper that 
              was published in Havana from 1932 until 1960.</font></p>
            <p></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David Rafal&iacute;n 
              served as rabbi of Adath Israel until 1932, when he moved to Mexico; 
              Rafalin's position at Adath Israel was filled after his departure 
              by Rabbi Eichenstein, who stayed for a year and a half (1936-1937).</font></p>
            <p></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Adath Israel was situated 
              at Jes&uacute;s Mar&iacute;a 103. The breakaway Knesseth Israel 
              was in the next building, at Jes&uacute;s Mar&iacute;a 105. In February 
              1949, twenty years after splitting apart, the two congregations 
              merged together under the shortly-lived new name, Ahdut (&quot;Unity&quot;) 
              Yisrael. Meir Rosenbaum assumed the elected position of Rabbi (essentially 
              the Ashkenazi Rabbi of Havana) on 1 April 1948.</font></p>
            <p></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was obvious that new 
              community institutions were needed for the post-War era, and community-wide 
              solutions were sought. Unity, however, was not forthcoming. The 
              discussions to build a new synagogue to replace Adath Israel/Knesseth 
              Israel split the Building Committee. On 8 December 1949 it was decided 
              to build a new synagogue in Vedado. That is the origin of the Patronato. 
              Rabbi Rosenbaum (1910-&nbsp;) and Adath Israel President Ben Zion 
              Dizik (1888-1960) joined the Vedado group.</font></p>
            <p></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet, many Ashkenazi Jews 
              remained in Habana Vieja. They eventually decided that a new synagogue 
              would be constructed at the corner of Picota and Acosta Streets, 
              which stood at the heart of what was the Jewish Quarter of Habana 
              Vieja. Oscar Baisman was the architect of the new building, and 
              Jacinto Feh Leonard served as construction engineer. The new building 
              included a sanctuary with six hundred seats, a chapel, and a reception 
              hall. The cornerstone for the new $100,000 synagogue building was 
              laid in April 1956. Construction was finished on 9 October 1959. 
              Kalman Wodonos became the new president of&nbsp;Adath Israel. (Wodonos 
              left Cuba for Florida after the Revolution.) </font> </p>
