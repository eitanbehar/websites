              <p> <strong>A HOUSE DIVIDED BY CLASH OF THE GODS</strong> 
              <p> Cuban Santeria priests bump heads over politics on year's predictions 
              <p> January 9, 1997, in the Miami Herald<br>
                By JUAN O. TAMAYO<br>
                Herald Staff Writer 
              <p> The high priests of Afro-Cuban religions have issued their prognostications 
                for the year 1997. Not surprisingly, they are deeply divided along 
                Cuba’s political fault line. 
              <p> In Havana, pro-Castro high priests known as babalawos say their 
                gods predicted a good year, with social peace and bounteous harvests. 
                But less revolutionary brethren in Havana forecast hunger and 
                job problems in 1997. 
              <p> In Miami, anti-Castro babalawos say their Gods spoke of civil 
                war and the death of President Fidel Castro. Those cheery Havana 
                predictions, they sneer, are dirty manipulations by Castro’s secret 
                police. 
              <p> ``There’s little ethics and too much politics in this,’’ moaned 
                Jose Montoya, a Miami babalawo who said he has been called a ``Castro 
                agent’’ because he accepts the predictions of a Havana group recognized 
                by Castro’s government. 
              <p> <img src="africa.gif" align=RIGHT> The gap between predictions 
                might seem absurd, were it not for the fact that many Cubans give 
                serious weight to the forecasts divined by babalawos from seashells 
                and other sacred objects during secret rituals each Dec. 31. Cuban 
                police briefly detained one babalawo last January after one forecast 
                predicted a wave of government repression in 1996. And academic 
                experts on Afro-Cuban religions say they don’t doubt that Havana 
                security agents manipulate the annual predictions for political 
                gain. 
              <p> Then there are those predictions that come eerily close to reality: 
                Forecasts of security crackdowns and hurricanes in 1996 came true, 
                with a harsh wave of arrests of Concilio Cubano dissidents in 
                February and Hurricane Lili’s destructive rampage through central 
                Cuba in October. 
              <p> The 1994 predictions that many Cubans would ``take baths in 
                the ocean’’ and ``remain unburied’’ coincided with the rafter 
                crisis that saw some 36,000 Cubans flee the island aboard homemade 
                rafts and boats, and an undetermined number drown. 
              <p> ``There are lies and politics, but the real predictions are 
                gods speaking,’’ said Rigoberto Zamora, head of the Miami-based 
                International Federation of Afro-Cuban Yoruba Religion, who faced 
                four charges of cruelty to animals over a televised sacrifice 
                in 1995. 
              <p> `Worst year ever’ 
              <p> A 59-year-old Cuban army veteran who fought against Castro in 
                the late 1950s and now leads the Association of Veterans of the 
                Anti-Communist War of Cuba, Zamora said the gods consulted by 
                his federation’s eight babalawos predicted ``the worst year ever’’ 
                for Cuba in 1997. 
              <p> ``On Cuba, the predictions speak of a civil war, of a revolution 
                within the revolution,’’ he said. A separate ritual in early December 
                to divine Castro’s future had this result: ``It’s his time to 
                die.’’ 
              <p> To get protection from evil, believers should place ``a white 
                flag with a painted elephant’’ over the doors to their homes, 
                Zamora’s group reported in an English-language fax sent to reporters. 
              <p> The prediction, also known as the Oddun or Letter, also forecast 
                violent weather and an increase in street crime. Some predictions 
                apply to both Cuba and Miami, Zamora said. 
              <p> The Odduns often contain vague phrases and anecdotes or parables. 
                ``ICA Ogunda Ano Osobo, governing INLE and OSAIN,’’ was part of 
                the Zamora group’s Oddun for 1997. Babalawos interpret the text, 
                based on their own knowledge and sacred texts. 
              <p> A different group 
              <p> A different forecast by a group of Havana babalawos regarded 
                by academic experts as free of government influence predicted 
                1997 would see hunger and problems with work everything from unemployment 
                to job accidents and repression for written works. 
              <p> But they predicted a relatively good year for Cuba: no weather 
                catastrophes or civil war and only ``a change of head,’’ presumed 
                to refer to changes among Cuban government leaders and not Castro 
                himself. 
              <p> These babalawos make their forecasts public through a trusted 
                outsider and refuse to be identified even by their ``families’’ 
                the clans that initiated them into cults that combine elements 
                of Roman Catholicism and African religions imported by black slaves. 
              <p> A third forecast by Havana babalawos published over the weekend 
                by Cuba’s official Prensa Latina news agency predicted 1997 would 
                be ``a good year for money’’ and agriculture, despite serious 
                work problems. 
              <p> ``Anyone who has a job should care for it, because it will be 
                a difficult year in which to find a new job,’’ said the prediction, 
                which added that all Cubans should seek ``reconciliation’’ to 
                improve their lives in 1997. 
              <p> A fourth prediction issued by babalawos from five well-known 
                and respected ``families’’ in Havana also mentions problems at 
                the workplace and rising street crime, Miami’s Montoya said. 
              <p> Criticized as a fraud 
              <p> Some of those babalawos are linked to the Havana-based Yoruba 
                Cultural Association of Cuba, officially created in 1991 and criticized 
                by Miami Santeria followers as a fraud. Association members have 
                government permission to charge U.S. dollars to Cuban exiles and 
                foreigners being initiated into the Afro-Cuban religions. 
              <p> ``That’s nothing but a cultural front created by the government 
                to bring in hard currency,’’ said Ernesto Pichardo, president 
                of the Hialeah-based Church of Babalu Aye. 
              <p> Montoya said the five families’ Oddun is the one he accepts, 
                however, even though some ``politically distorted’’ versions now 
                circulate in Cuba, because the families have the longest tradition 
                of issuing New Year’s Odduns. 
              <p> ``In Cuba and Miami there are people we don’t know if they have 
                bad intentions or political goals of some kind who are issuing 
                their own Odduns. That is all very suspicious,’’ Montoya said. 
              <p> ``Some say there’s manipulation by Castro security agents. It’s 
                not me who says that, but it is said. Others are more anti-Castro 
                than religious. There’s a lot of disunity, and everyone does what 
                they want to do.'' 
              <p> ``It's such a mess,'' he said.
