        - The Strength of the Community </b></font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> In my preparations 
          for writing an article on Dr. Jose Miller, president of the Joint Coordinating 
          Committee (J.C.C.) and thereby leader of the Jewish community in Cuba 
          as well as President of La Casa de la Comunidad Hebrea de Cuba and the 
          Beit Shalom synagogue, I spent many hours watching his movements and 
          actions around the Patronato, Havana's Jewish Community Center. Dr. 
          Miller's reputation had come to me in many forms, and I wanted to observe 
          the man myself before interviewing him. He had been described to me 
          in several terms, many of them contradictory, all of them interesting. 
          </font> 
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"He is a strong 
          leader," I was told. "He has kept the community together, through its 
          darkest and most difficult times." </font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"He cares for 
          everyone," someone else told me. "He will take the time to speak to 
          anyone coming in, he meets all the groups that visit, he spends his 
          spare time at the Patronato making sure things are going well." <img src="art02.jpg" width="248" height="138" align="left" vspace="6" hspace="8"></font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"His knowledge 
          of Cuba's Jewish community is immense," says another. "Just ask him 
          anything you want, and he will know something about it." </font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"He may not have 
          time for you," another person told me. "He is very busy and if he does 
          not think what you are doing is important you may not be able to speak 
          with him." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> This last comment 
          proved untrue. After a week or so of hanging around the Patronato I 
          told Dr. Miller I would like an "entrevista," an interview, and that 
          I would get a translator so we could do it in Spanish. He agreed to 
          this and we set a time several days away. The day came and I knew that 
          events would probably interfere, and that the interview might get put 
          off for hours or days or even a week or so. But on that day, as I waited 
          outside watching Havana's traffic flowing on Linea and the streets near 
          the synagogue, Miller came out the door and said "Let's go." There was 
          no translator available, and we did the interview in English, in which 
          Miller is fluent. </font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> We went upstairs 
          to the main sanctuary, where I took a few photos, then Miller sat in 
          one of the empty seats and we began our conversation. For the next two 
          hours the talk would range over many topics, including the necessary 
          adaptations of Judaism made by the Cubans to ensure the survival of 
          the religion in that country, why Miller stayed in Cuba when ninety 
          percent of the Jewish population left, the Russian presence, the loosening 
          restrictions on all religions in 1991, and other subjects. Miller's 
          range of knowledge is great, as I was told. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> I started with 
          a question I thought I knew the answer to, but was wrong. "When was 
          the most difficult time for Cuban Judaism?" I asked, expecting to be 
          told that it was in 1959 when the Jewish population was around 15,000 
          and quickly diminished to around 1,500. </font> 
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"No, that's not 
          it," says Miller. "Those were hard times but not the worst. The worst 
          came in 1938 and 1939 when the Nazis spent a lot of money here trying 
          to create anti-Semitism in Cuba. Those were dangerous times for us. 
          But it did not work. Cuba did not become anti-Semitic, and even today 
          you can see that it is not." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> This lack of anti-Semitism 
          in Cuba is observed by many, although official support for Israel is 
          lacking from the government. Miller smiles as he discusses this. "I 
          will never say one word against Israel to please anyone," he says. "I 
          will discuss this only with Jews." <img src="art11.jpg" width="239" height="151" align="right" vspace="6" hspace="8"></font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> And then he says, 
          in a remark which is profound in the complex environment in which he 
          lives, "You cannot oblige me to think like you." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> This adherence 
          to principles, even in difficult times, has enabled Dr. Miller to help 
          keep Judaism alive and vital in Cuba. "We were not able to get a minyan 
          for services," he says. "So we had to decide. Should we not have services, 
          or should we include women? We included women, we were able to get a 
          minyan, and we had services." </font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Miller also approaches 
          the concept of Jewish identity with flexibility. "It is not necessary 
          to have a Jewish mother to be considered Jewish in our congregation," 
          says Miller. "If somewhere in your family there is someone who was Jewish, 
          an uncle, a grandparent, we will consider you Jewish." This open attitude 
          is supported by recent studies which indicate a large proportion of 
          Cuba's population has Jewish roots. (See the related article from the 
          Miami Herald.) It has also helped rebuild the Jewish population by not 
          keeping to a strict Orthodox interpretation of who is Jewish and who 
          is not. </font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Our conversation 
          has moved outside and Miller takes time to discuss the cleaning of the 
          synagogue's marble steps. There is a detailed discussion with the workman 
          as to what methods will be used, and what cleaners are appropriate. 
          After all the details are agree upon, we move downstairs to the library, 
          where it is cooler. I asked Miller how he would describe the congregation's 
          affiliation. </font> 
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"We are more Conservative," 
          he says. "We cannot be Reform or Orthodox, because most of our members 
          prefer the conservative services. And I don't need tefillin to remind 
          myself that I am a Jew, even though when I saw a photo of Julius Rosenberg 
          buried with tallit, I was impressed by that photo." </font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The complexities 
          of being Jewish in Cuba are made more complicated by other factors. 
          "Marx hating being Jewish," says Miller. "He was the Jewish grandson 
          of a rabbi and hated it. And for this reason I cannot be a Marxist." 
          </font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"The revolution 
          in Cuba was not against Judaism," he continues. "Economically the Jewish 
          community was strong, but then businesses disappeared, and there was 
          no economic future for businessmen. So the sooner they left the better. 
          But I never thought about leaving. I had four children here, and I stayed." 
          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Dr. Miller, whose 
          parents came from Lithuania, is a medical school graduate in dentistry, 
          with 30 years of private practice. After 1960, with the proliferation 
          of firearms in the country, Miller says there were many accidents, so 
          he developed a specialty in reconstructive surgery, particularly reconstructive 
          surgery of the face. He worked in both the general and military hospital, 
          and in 1972 became head of his specialty in Havana's largest hospital, 
          where he worked for 22 years. </font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> He is uncomfortable 
          with being described as the "Patriarch" of Cuba's Jewish community, 
          or as "Father" of the community. "I don't talk about me," Miller says, 
          and I found this to be true, that he was more comfortable talking about 
          his community than talking about himself. "Talk about what we were, 
          and are now. " </font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"When the community 
          started rebuilding," he says, "reality was distant from Jewish traditions. 
          When the Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) came to Cuba, conservative 
          rabbis came to draw guidelines, to make us more kosher." Miller gives 
          great credit to the JDC in helping to rebuild, but also says, &quot;We 
          have appreciated the help of the Americans, Canadians and others who 
          have helped us in our efforts to draw closer to our Jewish heritage 
          .&quot;</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> After the Russians 
          departed, Miller believes that Cuba had to change. "Castro had to change," 
          he says, "and he had to adapt to survive. He invited in people like 
          Milton Friedman to give economic advice. It was a time of rebuilding, 
          for the country as well as for our Jewish community." <img src="art03.jpg" width="265" height="182" align="right" vspace="6" hspace="8"></font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Our conversation 
          is interrupted again by several people, including the JDC's Nestor Szewach, 
          who has some Passover arrangements to discuss, and Miller's wife Dahlia, 
          who also works at the Patronato and has an urgent call for Miller from 
          Argentina. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> When he has finished 
          with his phone call, Miller looks at me and says, "Dahlia is my second 
          wife (photo at right). My first wife, who is William's grandmother (William 
          Miller is the head of the Patronato's ORT program) died, and I later 
          married Dahlia. She was not Jewish, and converted. I have two children 
          from my first marriage, a daughter in Florida, a son in Israel. My son 
          in Israel wanted to be officially Jewish by Israeli law, and was converted 
          by an Orthodox Sephardic rabbi." </font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> In 1993 Miller 
          had a heart attack and was treated in Fairfax, Virginia. In 2001 he 
          had a recurrence of the symptoms. "How are you now?" I ask. "I'm taking 
          care of myself," he replies. "I'm eating better and being more careful 
          about my health." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> In the three weeks 
          I was in Cuba I spent many hours observing Dr. Jose Miller and his activities. 
          Whether he was speaking to an individual, or to a family at a Bar Mitzvah, 
          or to a group of visiting synagogue members from another country, or 
          just responding to the community's needs, he exhibited a strong commitment 
          to Judaism. In a country which has lost 90 percent of its Jewish population 
          to other countries, and in which the practice of religion was discouraged 
          for decades, only strong leadership could keep the religion viable and 
          thriving. Dr. Jose Miller has met the challenges of revitalizing Judaism 
          in Cuba, and remains one of the main strengths of Cuba's Jewish community.
