              <h3>Who are the Crypto-Jews (also known as "marranos")?</h3>
              <h3>&#169 (c) 1993-1997 Daniel P. Faigin <a href="mailto:faigin@shamash.org">&#60;faigin@shamash.org&#62;</a> 
              </h3>
              At the time of the Spanish Inquisition and the expulsion from Spain 
              in 1492, Jews were offered conversion or expulsion. Many chose to 
              leave Spain (quite a few found safety in the Muslim Ottoman Empire), 
              but others stayed behind. 
              <p> "Marranos" actually started appearing with the first riots in 
                the Juderias of Spain. Many were forced to convert to save their 
                lives. These were naturally not faithful Catholics. The laws in 
                14th and 15th century Spain became increasingly oppressive towards 
                practicing Jews, while providing an easy escape by conversion. 
                Large numbers of middle class Jews outwardly took on Christianity 
                to avoid the laws, while secretly practicing Judaism. 
              <p> Most of the remaining Marranic practice in Spain and Portugal 
                today is from those religious Jews who escaped from Spain to Portugal 
                in 1492, only to be trapped there later when the expulsion was 
                instituted there as well. The most active Marranism in the Iberian 
                peninsula is in the mountainous border areas between Spain and 
                Portugal, in towns such as Belmonte'. Jewish outreach in these 
                areas is achieving success in bringing them forward and restoring 
                full Judaic practice, but many still fear burning or other persecution 
                if they go public. 
              <p> Some faithful Catholic converts were won by the efforts of famous 
                apostates like Pablo de Santa Maria who went around disputing 
                the rabbis and ordinary Jews, winning some converts. In the most 
                famous disputation, with Nachmanides, he was soundly defeated, 
                but the Franciscans published false reports of the disputation 
                to win more converts. Nachmanides, who had been protected from 
                heresy laws during the disputations, was forced to publish his 
                refutations in public. He was forced into exile rather than be 
                burned as a heretic. In any case, the faithfulness of these converts 
                is doubtful, since the Order of Expulsion was primarily due to 
                the recidivism of Conversos once they had to live next door to 
                practicing Jews again. It was felt that expelling all open Jews 
                was the only way to keep the Conversos Christian. 
              <p> Among those who stayed behind were Jews who pretended to convert 
                to Roman Catholicism, but who secretly maintained a practice of 
                Judaism. The term "Marrano" was at one time used to describe them, 
                as the term refers to the swine which they'd publicly eat to demonstrate 
                their outward conversion. It isn't clear if the "Old Christians" 
                or the practicing Jews called them "marrano". 
              <p> In Majorca the community was converted in the 1430's and are 
                called Chuetas, from "pork lard" since they regularly keep pork 
                lard boiling in cauldrons on their porches. They themselves still 
                call themselves Israelitas in private, and ask forgiveness from 
                el Grande Dio for worshipping in front of statues of a man. They 
                typically sacrified (in a figurative, not literal, sense) their 
                first born sons to the Catholic priesthood as a means of getting 
                protection from Church persecution, so, ironically, many of the 
                priests across the Baleiric Islands are from Marrano families. 
              <p> Crypto-Jew is the correct term, as it also refers to Jews forced 
                to adopt other religions and political philosophies while maintaining 
                Jewish practices. Crypto-Judaism pre-dates the Inquisition, as 
                Jews were forced by the Al-Mohavid invasions of Spain to become 
                Muslims, creating Crypto-Jews who gradually fled to Christian 
                districts for protection from the Muslims (see Roth's <cite>History 
                of the Jews</cite>). In modern times outwardly Muslim Crypto-Jews 
                are known to be in Meshed, Iran, and in Turkey. 
              <p> A number of Crypto-Jewish communities survive today, especially 
                in former Spanish-influenced regions, such as the southwestern 
                U.S.A. They still maintain extensive secrecy after centuries. 
                Other communities were lost to assimilation, but maintained residual 
                Jewish practices such as lighting candles Friday night. Based 
                on information in Cohen's <cite>The Marranos</cite> and Prinz's 
                <cite>The Secret Jews</cite>, the following are some examples 
                of these communities: 
              <p> 
              <ul>
                <li> The Antiquen~as of Colombia. 
                <li> Much of Northern Mexico's middle and upper classes (Nuevo 
                  Leon is the "New Lion of Judah"). 
                <li> The Naucalpan and Vallejo districts of Mexico City. (Technically, 
                  Naucalpan is not in the Distrito Federal, but in the greater 
                  metropolitan area). 
                <li> The Chuetas of Majorca. A look at Chueta last names shows 
                  many surnames which have became quite famous in the Hispanic 
                  world. They include Mir, Miro, and Marti. Of course Joan Miro 
                  was Mallorcan. Any marranism in Fidel Castro's family would 
                  be through his mother, as his father's family was Gallego, and 
                  very few Jews ever lived in Galicia (of course plenty lived 
                  in the Austrian Galicia, I'm refering to northwestern Spain). 
                  Interesting about the mountains on the Spanish-Portuguese border 
                  being a hotbed of marranism, particularly those on the Extremadura-Andalucia 
                  border. This area is directly inland from some of the areas 
                  which contained the earliest Jewish communities on the Iberian 
                  peninsula - for example Huelva and Gibraltar. Malaga and Almunecar 
                  - which also had early communities - are also in Andalucia. 
                  According to Timothy Mitchell's book <cite>Flamenco: Deep Song</cite> 
                  and other sources, the inquisition in western Andalucia was 
                  slightly more lenient than elsewhere because of the need for 
                  labour related for the new world trade and mining. The connections 
                  are quite interesting. 
              </ul>
              <p> Famous Hispanics who have acknowledged Marrano ancestry include 
                Rita Moreno and Fidel Castro. Jews have played an important role 
                in the history of Monterrey, Mexico. The Garza family, one of 
                Mexico's richest, of Cerveceria Moctezuma fame, are Jews. Frida 
                Kahlo's father, Guillermo Kahlo, a somewhat reknowned photographer 
                in his own right, was a Hungarian Jew. Diego Rivera admitted having 
                marrano ancestry as well.
