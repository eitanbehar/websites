              <blockquote> 
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> <font color="#000066">In March 
                  2000, the Canadian Jewish Congress, Ontario region (CJC), continued 
                  a tradition of <i>chesed</i> that it has maintained for almost 
                  40 years. </font></font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1" color="#000066">On March 31 a 
                  Cubana Airlines plane took off from Montreal's Mirabel airport 
                  carrying Passover foodstuffs to the Jewish community in Cuba. 
                  A second plane departed on the following day to complete the 
                  shipment. In all, almost 10,000 kilograms (more than 20,000 
                  pounds) of food, including wine, matzoh, fish and cooking oil 
                  were transported in time for distribution to Jewish families 
                  throughout the Republic of Cuba. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1" color="#000066">CJC's commitment 
                  to this humanitarian effort began after the 1961 revolution 
                  and has continued to this day. The motivation for this annual 
                  effort can be found in the pages of the Passover Haggadah, the 
                  narration of the exodus from Egypt that is a central piece of 
                  the festival. The liturgy of Passover impels Jews to ensure 
                  that all who are hungry have a place at the traditional seder 
                  table.<img src="cjc1.jpg" width="364" height="250" align="right" vspace="6" hspace="6"><br>
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1" color="#000066">This year's effort 
                  was highlighted by the significant cooperation and assistance 
                  that CJC received from the Government of the Republic of Cuba. 
                  In previous years, transportation was split between air and 
                  sea in order to reduce costs. This year, the Cuban government 
                  offered to transport 4000 kilograms free of charge and to considerably 
                  discount the remainder of the shipment. The generosity of the 
                  Cuban government ensured that our friends in Cuba received this 
                  important shipment in plenty of time to ensure proper distribution. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1" color="#000066">CJC is proud to 
                  be a part of an ongoing relationship with the Jewish community 
                  in Cuba and is particularly grateful for the opportunity to 
                  work closely with communal representatives like Dr. Jose Miller 
                  and Adela Dworin (of the Casa de la Comunidad Hebrea de Cuba, 
                  Patronato) and to partner with the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, 
                  a US-based human rights organization which provides an annual 
                  donation to purchase additional foodstuffs for shipment to Cuba.
