          Man in Cuba</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The first impression 
          William Miller makes is that he is a highly-intelligent and focused 
          young man. William, a professor in electronics at Havana Technological 
          University, working on a graduate degree in telecommunications and software 
          engineering, is also head of the <a href="ort.html">ORT</a> computer 
          laboratory located in the Patronato, Havana압 Jewish Community Center. 
          </font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> As part of his 
          involvement with ORT (ORT is an acronym for the original Russian name), William has pioneered the creation of an extensive 
          website for the Patronato and for Cuba압 other Jewish communities. www.chcuba.org 
          has recently gone online and is being developed as both a Spanish and 
          English-language site, with extensive coverage of local events and history. 
          "We want to show the real life of the Cuban Jewish community through 
          our eyes," he says. "You have to live here to understand what is going 
          on. This site is created one hundred percent by local people." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> It is some of 
          these local people that William is helping train through the facilities 
          provided by ORT, and through the involvement of the Patronato. "Just 
          two years ago this website was only an idea," he says. "Then we started 
          gathering information, and a team came together consisting of a designer, 
          two software engineers, a journalism student, and myself." <img src="art12.jpg" width="293" height="220" align="right" vspace="6" hspace="6"></font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Part of this gathering 
          of information resulted in a newsletter, "Menorah," which for the time 
          being serves the same purpose as a website, although on a less global 
          scale. "Most communities don앖 have access to the internet," says William, 
          "so it is difficult to communicate what we are trying to do." Internet 
          access in Cuba is restricted to academic and other professional institutions, 
          with some rare individual exceptions. "We try to simulate an internet 
          environment by setting up an intranet," says William, "but it just isn앖 
          the same thing." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Within this environment 
          of limited access William has managed to put together a professional 
          website, using an ORT server in London, with the site압 content created 
          entirely in Cuba. "In the future," he says, "we hope to get our English 
          version online, and also provide a more comprehensive and frequently-updated 
          resource so that people logging on can know what is happening and when 
          it is happening. We want to have all the necessary contact information 
          easily available." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> When asked about 
          how the Cuban-based site would interact with other sites which have 
          Cuban Judaism as a focus (such as jewishcuba.org), Williams says there 
          is room for all. "We will have a unique local focus which other sites 
          cannot have, because they are not here," he says. "But we all need each 
          other. We need the external sites for resources and as a means to share 
          information. The external sites need us for our local perspective and 
          experience." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Although William압 
          work with the website is just a small part of his involvement, it promises 
          to eventually have the most visibility. Even as he works to promote 
          ORT압 goal of providing technological information for the Jewish people, 
          and provides education for Havana압 Jewish community and others, his 
          and his team압 involvement with the website will continue. </font>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"It압 not finished," 
          he says. "This will be something we continue to work on. It will always 
          be improving." </font>
