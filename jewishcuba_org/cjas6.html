              <p>Washington, D.C. (February 12, 1997) -- Armed with suitcases 
                overflowing with heart medications, vitamins, cough syrups, and 
                other medicines, 32 people from across North America participated 
                in a B'nai B'rith humanitarian mission to Cuba seeking to help 
                the Jewish community physically and spiritually. The participants 
                came back with a grim report. Medicines, food (including milk) 
                and clothes are either non-existent or are unaffordable. The children 
                are in particular need. They are not allowed any milk after two 
                years of age, with the exception of a medical emergency, and are 
                in desperate need of vitamins. One shirt costs one month's salary. 
              </p>
              <p>Six of the participants were born in Cuba including Michael Mandel, 
                a cantorial student who performed several Judaic concerts for 
                the culturally-starved community accompanied by Cuban-born Ruth 
                Padorr, now a businesswoman in Chicago. </p>
              <p>After returning from the recent trip and seeing the lack of medical 
                supplies and food available, B'nai B'rith International has formed 
                a new committee to provide medicines, clothing and educational 
                materials on an ongoing basis to the 1,600-person Cuban Jewish 
                community and to inform Jews worldwide of their plight.</p>
              <p>Richard D. Heideman, international chairman of B'nai B'rith's 
                Center For Public Policy, has selected Elizabeth (Betty) Baer 
                chairperson of the new B'nai B'rith Committee on Cuban Affairs. 
                Baer is a paralegal from Richmond, and is the wife of B'nai B'rith's 
                international president, Tommy P. Baer. </p>
              <p>"In keeping with B'nai B'rith's 153 year tradition of providing 
                aid to Jews throughout the world, we have created this special 
                committee to assist in improving the lives of this isolated community 
                who are in desperate need of even the basic necessities of life," 
                said Heideman. Heideman also appointed Irving Silver, an attorney 
                from Mobile, Alabama, the Vice Chairman of the Committee on Cuban 
                Affairs. Silver is the former chairman of the Center for Public 
                Policy.</p>
              <p>"We plan to obtain and send educational and religious materials 
                written in Spanish and sponsor more humanitarian missions," said 
                Mrs. Baer. "The needs are immense."</p>
              <p>The Maimonedes Lodge of B'nai B'rith was founded in Havana in 
                1943. Strengthening the programmatic relationship with this lodge 
                will be another goal of the committee. B'nai B'rith is in a unique 
                position to aid the Jews of Cuba because of its worldwide membership 
                and its Latin American units throughout the U.S. </p>
