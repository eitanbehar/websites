                January 26, 1998</b></font> </div>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">HAVANA - Pope John Paul II preached 
                the word of God yesterday to hundreds of thousands of people gathered 
                inside the Plaza of the Revolution, transforming the sacred ground 
                of Cuban socialism into a forum for free expression neither seen 
                nor heard here in four decades. </font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">As John Paul expanded his withering 
                critique of a society stripped of religion, Cubans jammed shoulder-to-shoulder 
                roared in approval and shook their heads in disbelief. They laughed, 
                embraced, and chanted ''Viva El Papa!'' for a pope credited with 
                destabilizing Communism in Eastern Europe. </font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The estimated turnout for the 
                final Mass of the five-day pilgrimage averaged about 500,000 - 
                a sea of worshipers waving banners and tiny Cuban and Vatican 
                flags. From within the crowd, which included President Fidel Castro, 
                solitary cries of ''freedom'' and ''justice'' could be heard as 
                the pope delivered his powerful homily. </font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">''For the first time in the entire 
                history of the revolution, another voice has been heard,'' said 
                Lourdes Maria Alonzo, a 34-year-old psychologist. ''In this country, 
                you can't say these things.''</font> 
              <p align="left"><img src="pope.jpg" width="200" height="344" align="right"> 
                <font face="Arial"> </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Facing a 20-story image of Ernesto 
                ''Che'' Guevara, Cuba's atheist martyr, the pope refused even 
                to use the plaza's post-revolutionary name, referring to it instead 
                as the Plaza of Jose Marti. ''The attainment of freedom,'' he 
                told the crowd, ''is a duty which no one can shirk.'' He called 
                on Christians to work toward a ''liberation'' that ''reaches its 
                fullness in the exercise of freedom of conscience, the basis and 
                foundation of all other human rights.''</font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">With the crowd cheering after 
                almost every sentence, the feeble 77-year-old pontiff said finally: 
                ''The pope is not against applause. Applause allows the pope to 
                rest.'' He ended his homily by turning the legacy of Jose Marti 
                - the poet/hero of Cuban independence - against a government that 
                has held up Marti as an icon of Marxist-Leninist ideology. </font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">''An irreligious people will 
                die, because nothing in it encourages virtue,'' said the pope, 
                quoting Marti. ''Human injustices offend virtue; it is necessary 
                that heavenly justice guarantee it.''</font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The pope left Cuba early yesterday 
                evening with the biggest question hanging in the air: whether 
                his visit can bring about long-expected political change on the 
                island. Before last year, no public Mass had been held in Cuba 
                in 35 years. Until 1992, Catholics were denied entry into the 
                Communist Party, discriminated against in the workplace and held 
                back from educational opportunities. </font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The pilgrimage, in which the 
                pope pressed directly for the expansion of Catholic education, 
                is certain to bolster interest in the rapidly expanding Cuban 
                church. He denied that the church's motives were political. </font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">However, many people also believe 
                that the pope has christened the church as a refuge for independent 
                thought and passive resistance against the Castro government. 
                Enrique Aguilar, a 28-year-old engineer, who attended the Mass 
                with several friends, said the pope ''has opened up the minds 
                of every single person in Cuba. Look at me: I grew up in the revolution. 
                I've known only one conception of the world.''</font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">During the homily, Zoyga Garcia, 
                a petite 65-year-old retired office worker, yelled: ''Pope, please, 
                bring us justice!'' Afterward, she was even more pointed: ''Democracy: 
                that's what people lack here, and make sure you write my name 
                down. We're a repressed people, we're living in misery. I think 
                what the pope has done is teach us how to resist.''</font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The pope appears to be seeking 
                a compromise that would end the polarization between the Cuban 
                and US governments; bring together the island with its country 
                in exile, some 1 million Cubans living abroad; and prepare it 
                for a ''soft landing'' during the inevitable transition when Castro, 
                71, finally fades away. </font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">''Cuba needs to open herself 
                up to the world and the world needs to draw close to Cuba,'' he 
                said. Before his departure, he delivered his strongest criticism 
                yet of the 35-year-old US trade embargo against the island, decrying 
                ''oppressive economic measures - unjust and ethically unacceptable 
                - imposed from outside the country.''</font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">He also lashed out at capitalism 
                ''which subordinates the human person to blind market forces and 
                conditions the development of peoples on those forces.''</font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Castro emphasized his common 
                ground with the pope as he bid him farewell, thanking him ''for 
                every word you have said - even those I might disagree with.'' 
                </font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">''I think we have given the world 
                a good example,'' Castro said. ''You, by visiting what some choose 
                to call communism's last bulwark; we by receiving the religious 
                leader who had been imputed responsibility for the destruction 
                of socialism in Europe. There were those who forbode apocalyptic 
                events; some even dreamed of them.''</font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Standing in the rain, the pope 
                joked to the farewell crowd: ''Is it that the people of Cuba are 
                crying because the pope is leaving?''</font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The pope's most dramatic effect 
                so far has been to expose Cubans to an authority beyond Castro. 
                From the beginning of his visit, life here was altered. Yesterday, 
                after walking past the ubiquitous slogans of the revolution, painted 
                on virtually every wall, Cubans arrived at the plaza to see the 
                immense image of Che challenged by a mural of Jesus on the facade 
                of the National Library. </font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">As in the three previous Masses, 
                party sympathizers lined the periphery, but they were dwarfed 
                by the crowd. They stood in lines, as people danced in circles, 
                raised signs bearing images of the pope and screamed: ''Cuba always 
                was Catholic! Cuba always was Catholic.''</font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Unlike previous Masses, where 
                people talked during the homily, mingled, or simply walked away, 
                the crowd hung on the pope's every word. People who talked were 
                told to ''shhhhh'' by those around them. Within 1,000 yards of 
                the stage, the plaza was packed, but many people still pushed 
                forward, trying to get closer to the pope. </font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Many people, attending their 
                first Mass, appeared confused and needed to consult a 31-page 
                guide prepared by the church to follow along. But nearly everyone 
                sung and prayed aloud, a mass of humanity, schooled in atheism, 
                pledging its profession of faith: </font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">''Do you believe in the Almighty 
                God, creator of Heaven and Earth?'' the pope asked. </font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">''Yes, I believe,'' the crowd 
                said in unison. </font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">''Do you believe in Jesus Christ, 
                his only son, our Lord, born of the Virgin Mary, who died, was 
                buried, was resurrected and is seated at the right hand of God?''</font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">''Yes, I believe.''</font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">After the Mass, a man wandered 
                through the crowd, joyous over what he had heard. Walking past 
                the students, who were still chanting for the pope, past the worshipers 
                dancing in a circle in the middle of the plaza, past a family 
                in mid-embrace, he walked up to a foreigner. </font> 
              <p align="left"> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">''We are living in darkness,'' 
                he said to the stranger. ''The sunrise, it is coming very soon.''</font>
