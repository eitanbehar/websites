              <blockquote> 
                <p><font color="#000066" face="Arial" size="-1">In proportional 
                  terms, Cuba offered refugee or migrant status to more Jews than 
                  any other Latin American country; more, in fact, than was offered 
                  by the United States. In addition, despite occasional periods 
                  of hostility by certain sectors of the Cuban elite, these Jews 
                  were afforded a good reception. Robert Levine offers three reasons 
                  for this unusual circumstance. First, Cuba had an open economy 
                  with a "worldly" elite, long accustomed to dealing with strangers. 
                  This explains the relative absence of the class-based ethnocentrism 
                  and anti-semitism often found among Latin American elites. To 
                  be sure, prejudice and discrimination existed but, according 
                  to the author, tended to be of the "petty" rather than the institutional 
                  sort. </font></p>
                <p><font color="#000066" face="Arial" size="-1"> Second, because 
                  the Jews settled all over Cuba rather than concentrating in 
                  one city (much less one neighborhood), their presence never 
                  engendered the "ghetto" syndrome so common in other countries. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font color="#000066" face="Arial" size="-1"> Finally, accomodation 
                  was facilitated by the fact that Jewish migration occurred in 
                  widely spaced historical sequences, each with different settlement 
                  patterns. The two earliest groups were very successful economically 
                  and incorporated themselves smoothly into Cuban society. First 
                  came the Spanish and Portuguese Sephardim, who arrived either 
                  with the conquering Spaniards or from the island of Curacao, 
                  the center of Sephardim culture in the Caribbean. Although not 
                  mentioned by the author, Cuba's most powerful "sugar baron," 
                  Julio Lobo, was a descendant of this group. This group is not 
                  to be confused with later Sephardim migrants from North Africa 
                  and the Otoman Empire. Religiously orthodox, poorly educated 
                  and non-Spanish speaking, these Jews were always disdainfully 
                  referred to as "Turcos." The second earliest migration was that 
                  of American Jews. They arrived with the United States occupation 
                  troops and held important technical and commercial positions 
                  from the start. </font></p>
                <p><font color="#000066" face="Arial" size="-1"> In some way, 
                  therefore, attitudes had been mellowed for later migrations. 
                  These tended to be Ashkenazim (generally referred to as "Polacos") 
                  and while they were not as easily incorporated as the earlier 
                  migrants, it is evident that things could have been much worse. 
                  Those who arrived in the 1920s and early 1930s included a good 
                  number of Marxists, who played a key role in the founding of 
                  Cuba's Communist party. In the 1930s, especially around the 
                  years of the Spanish Civil War, these Jews became targets of 
                  a small but influential sector of the elite that had Falangist 
                  leanings. These elites also opposed the entry of the next wave 
                  of Jews, the refugees from Nazism. Desperate to enter the United 
                  States they settled for Cuba as a safehaven but tended to see 
                  the islands as an "immigration hotel" (p. 285). The unintended 
                  consequence was that their aloofness minimized possible confrontations 
                  with local anti-Semites. It is to this group that the author 
                  gives the bulk of his attention, and it is their often-tragic 
                  story which provides him with his most dramatic material. </font></p>
                <p><font color="#000066" face="Arial" size="-1"> This book provides 
                  a powerful sense of hemispheric history repeating itself: refugees 
                  attempting to reach the United States by any means including 
                  expensive smugglers, the United States attempting to get alternate 
                  settlements for them in small Caribbean countries, and corrupt 
                  local officials and politicians enriching themselves from this 
                  sordid game of avoidance and callousness. As such, this book 
                  is about more than just a Jewish diaspora; it is about the many 
                  diasporas which have made the Caribbean Basin what it is.</font></p>
