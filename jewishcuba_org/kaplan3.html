                        <font color="#000000">A number of news reports suggested 
                        that the Cuban government was claiming victory in the 
                        propaganda war with the Cuban exiles, but it seems more 
                        likely that the exiles lost the battle all by themselves. 
                        Many of their spokespersons made inaccurate, exaggerated 
                        or blatantly false statements on TV, which didn't help 
                        their cause either. I heard respectable representatives 
                        argue, for example, that Cuban parents have no rights 
                        over their children in Cuba, but rather that the children 
                        were the property of the state. While this of course has 
                        a basis in the idiosyncratic Cuban Communist ideology, 
                        the way that it was presented was so distorted as to make 
                        it unrecognizable. </font></p>

                        <font color="#0080C0">I was resentful that the congress 
                        people and other Cuban American representatives in Florida 
                        who spoke so often and passionately on TV would alter 
                        the facts so blatantly. The inbred Miami Cuban community 
                        has taken the trauma that they experienced and magnified 
                        it to the point where just uttering the word Castro is 
                        enough to send them into fits of uncontrolled weeping, 
                        a phenomenon I watched on television numerous times. They 
                        act as if this was a community that experienced something 
                        of the magnitude of the holocaust. But this is not what 
                        happened to them, and without slighting the degree of 
                        trauma that they feel, I think I speak for a great many 
                        who believe that they can and should move on with their 
                        lives and that the American government should form a rational 
                        policy toward Cuba based on legitimate American political 
                        and economic interests, rather than on the intense hatred 
                        of a segment of the Cuban American community in South 
                        Florida.</font></font></p>
                      <p><font color="#0080C0">Elian was a symbol for both the 
                        Castro government and the conservative segment of the 
                        Cuban American community. For the conservative Cuban Americans 
                        the little boy represented freedom, specifically their 
                        struggle to leave Cuba as it became increasingly Communist 
                        and non-democratic. Most had their businesses confiscated 
                        and they felt betrayed by the revolutionary government, 
                        which many of them initially supported. For Castro, Elian 
                        Gonzalez represents an opportunity to proudly reassert 
                        the Cuban commitment to Cuban sovereignty. Castro has 
                        always been able to combine Cuban nationalism with loyalty 
                        to his own form of revolutionary government. The issue 
                        was ideal, because most Cubans could easily support the 
                        cause of returning Elian to his father to Cuba whether 
                        or not they were supporters of the regime, whether or 
                        not they were Communist sympathizers, and whether or not 
                        they felt the country was being managed competently.<br>

                        Many American rabbis discussed Elian in their sermons. 
                        Most are on the constant lookout for topics that their 
                        congregants will be able to relate to, and that they can 
                        conceptualize with a Jewish religious context. The Elian 
                        episode fit very nicely.</font></font></p>
                      <p><font color="#0080C0">Richard J. Shapiro of Congregation 
                        B'nai B'rith in Santa Barbara, California, argued that 
                        "there are many appropriate and moral ways in which we 
                        can express our disagreement with the government of Fidel 
                        Castro, but holding a 6-year old boy hostage is not one 
                        of them (1)." Shapiro writes that he supported the federal 
                        government decision to forcibly remove the little boy 
                        from the home of the "Miami relatives":</font></p>
                      <blockquote> 
                        <p><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I have never been more 
                          proud to be an American: proud that President Clinton 
                          and attorney General Reno decided that upholding the 
                          law was more important than playing to the crowds. It 
                          would have been very easy to grant young Elian asylum 
                          here, to grant his extended family custody of a motherless 
                          child and leave it at that. But this is a country of 
                          laws, and this child also has a father. We may detest 
                          the political system of Cuba; we may even believe that 
                          we have a right to work for its overthrow. But that 
                          isn't the same thing as denying a father and son their 
                          god-given right-absent any evidence of abuse or neglect-to 
                          be together. Juan Miguel Gonzalez has a right to raise 
                          his son, and if that means doing so in Cuba, as much 
                          as I might believe they would both be better off herein 
                          the United States, then so be it. I am proud that once 
                          again we can be seen in the eyes of the world as a nation 
                          of laws, not of political expediency.&quot; </font></p>

                      <p><font color="#000000">An interesting aspect of the lengthy 
                        debate on Elian was the comparison that was all too frequently 
                        made between Cuban migrants to the U.S. and holocaust 
                        refugees. Both politicians and commentators made this 
                        comparison, directly or indirectly, a comparison that 
                        is of course ridiculous. It is not necessary to add which 
                        side was using this polemical tool. New York Mayor Rudolph 
                        Guiliani stated that the federal troops that took Elian 
                        from his relatives' Miami home were "storm troopers". 
                        Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire called the Wye Plantation 
                        in eastern Maryland--where Elian stayed with his father-a 
                        "concentration camp". One of Smith's aides later said 
                        that the Senator had meant to say "re-education camp" 
                        rather than "concentration camp." (2)</font></p>
