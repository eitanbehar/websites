              <p>Only in the last decade or so have serious studies of Cuba's 
                Jews appeared. Traditional scholarship on Cuba overlooked the 
                subject, and when the studies started to appear, they were almost 
                always written by persons of Jewish background. Also appearing 
                were a half-dozen documentary films made by foreign Jews visiting 
                Cuba for brief periods of time to record the last surviving members 
                of the remnant community. The long-promised study of Cuban Jewry 
                from the inside, based on a lifetime of community activity by 
                Sender Kaplan, never appeared, the chance taken away by his illness 
                and death a few years ago. There have been no studies published 
                in Cuba, although a good deal of material pertinent to the institutional 
                history of Cuban Jewry sits in Cuban archives, and there is considerable 
                material available to scholars outside of Cuba as well, especially 
                in South Florida, Washington, D.C., and New York.</p>
              <p> The first generation of studies, as might be expected, was limited 
                in scope. Like most studies of immigrant and minority groups, 
                they tended to examine their subject by itself, rarely looking 
                at it in the broader national context. The focus of these studies 
                was invariably<i> institutional</i>, based on definitions by Jewish 
                organizations of who was and who was not a Jew. The studies were 
                further influenced by the tendency among Cuban-Jewish leaders 
                to speak in terms of a single Jewish community. Historical research 
                shows, however, that this was never the case, because Jewish groups 
                remained separated into groups on the basis of their ethnic origins 
                and language. When Jews first came in numbers to Cuba in the early 
                nineteenth century, Jews in Cuba, depending upon which group they 
                were in, spoke many different languages (English, Yiddish, Spanish, 
                Hungarian, Ladino, and later German). They also differed in custom 
                (Sephardic versus Ashkenazic versus Middle European versus American), 
                according to their religious affiliation or non-affiliation (ranging 
                from orthodoxy to rejection), their politics (socialists and communists 
                versus the majority stance, which was apolitical and accomodationist), 
                their attitudes about Zionism, their residence (urban versus small 
                town and rural) and, after 1959, their support or non-support 
                of Castro's Revolution.</p>
              <p>I argue that scholarly studies would benefit from moving to the 
                next level of complexity. We need to recognize the rich spectrum 
                that taken together represented the Jewish presence in Cuba, and 
                we need to deal with it dispassionately. We should be neither 
                celebratory nor judgmental and disparaging. The questions to be 
                examined are fascinating, but they need not be daunting to researchers 
                with open minds.</p>
              <p><font color="#000080"><b>Background:</b></font></p>
              <p> Well into the nineteenth century, Jews were barred from entering 
                the former lands of the Spanish empire legally, just as they had 
                been excluded from Czarist Russia until the last quarter of the 
                eighteenth century. Even after juridical barriers were lifted 
                and pioneer Jewish immigrants began to settle in Spanish and Portuguese-speaking 
                Latin America, the question remained to what extent Jews would 
                be granted legitimate status in the eyes of the majority.<sup>1</sup> 
                This was all the more difficult because Latin American societies 
                never accepted religious pluralism, and because the Jews who came 
                to the region tended to be persons fleeing repression or hardship, 
                not westernized Jews seeking to assimilate.</p>
              <p>In the United States and Canada, most Jews and other immigrants 
                gradually became absorbed into the primary groups of the host 
                society, receiving the same political rights as native-born citizens 
                and, within a few decades, earning acceptance into most if not 
                all sectors of society. This was much less true for the rest of 
                the hemisphere, a circumstance to some degree accepted both by 
                the creole elites and by the Jewish immigrant communities. Cuba 
                differed from most other Latin American places because the island's 
                indigenous culture had been eradicated; its culture became shaped 
                by foreigners, whether Spaniards or non-Spanish immigrants. None 
                of this took place before 1900, when fewer than 1,000 Europeans 
                who were not Spanish nationals lived on the island. By 1907 this 
                number would jump to 1,811, joined by 6,000 Americans. Twelve 
                years later, in 1917, there would be 5,619 Europeans (and 31,442 
                Americans); by 1931, 10,000 non-Spanish Europeans and 121,000 
                citizens of the United States or other hemispheric republics.<sup>2</sup></p>
              <p> With the influx into Cuba first of Sephardic Jews from the shores 
                of the Mediterranean, then Jews from the United States who came 
                during and after the U.S. invasion, and finally Ashkenazic Jews 
                fleeing poverty and the dislocations caused by World War I, Cuba's 
                Jewish colony grew to nearly 5,000 by 1923. The community, however, 
                remained in constant flux: thousands entered Cuba each year but 
                thousands left for the United States. For most of the newcomers, 
                especially the Ashkenazic Jews whose language was very different 
                from Spanish and who were bewildered by the heat and the social 
                conventions of the tropical island, life in the first decades 
                was harsh. Many made their living by peddling or by toiling twelve 
                hours a day in clothing workshops run by fellow immigrants. The 
                Great Depression wiped out some improvements that had been made 
                in the late 1920s, but within a decade the community had stabilized 
                and some of the immigrants had risen in economic status. Others, 
                however, remained poor until well after the Second World War.</p>
              <p> As the war approached, Jewish leaders worked out a <i>de facto</i> 
                arrangement whereby they would have access to the president when 
                needed. Such access proved to be limited in influence in the case 
                of pleas to permit refugees to embark during and after the tragic 
                <i>S.S. St. Louis</i> episode in 1939, but the Jewish colony remained 
                internally divided over what to do about the refugee problem. 
                Assistance was provided overwhelmingly by foreign Jewish relief 
                organizations; Cuban Jews, in most cases hard-pressed to meet 
                their own economic needs, did little to assist the refugees.</p>
              <p> Tensions rose in the mid-1930s with the influx of Nazi and Falangist 
                anti-semitic propaganda and its dissemination in the press and 
                on the radio, but war's end ushered in a golden era for Cuban 
                Jews. Depression-era poverty for most Jews gave way to economic 
                prosperity and greater social acceptance. Symbolically, Ashkenazic 
                Jews invited some Sephardic leaders to join with them in the planning 
                for the Patronato, an expensive and handsome Jewish Center inaugurated 
                in the waning days of the Batista dictatorship.</p>
              <p> Castro's revolution swiftly undercut that progress because Cuba's 
                Jews for the most part had become successful property owners, 
                and therefore were among the targets of nationalization and expropriation. 
                The Jews, most of whom had come from Europe, perceived very clearly 
                the telling signs in Castro's rhetoric foreshadowing trouble. 
                As a result, it was not difficult to opt for flight. Most of Cuba's 
                Jews ended up in South Florida and other parts of the U.S. and 
                in Puerto Rico. Fate played a trick on the Jews who had made Cuba 
                their tropical home. With the exception of the Central European 
                Jewish refugees, almost all of whom who managed to enter the United 
                States after temporary transit in Cuba for a year or less, the 
                Jews who were the most successful in accommodating to Cuban life 
                and who had prospered within it were the very same persons who 
                found themselves obliged to leave after the Cuban Revolution. 
                The stories of those who remained under the institutional umbrella 
                of the Jewish community are well known; less so are the experiences 
                of the thousands of Jews mostly from Eastern Europe who used Cuba 
                as a stepping-stone to the United States before 1924 and then 
                left for the mainland, or the hundreds and possibly thousands 
                who found ways to enter as permanent residents of the United States 
                after Congress imposed restrictive quotas in 1924, by marrying 
                American citizens or otherwise finding loopholes in the immigration 
                system. These individuals for practical necessity remained silent, 
                and their stories may never be known.</p>
              <p> Finally, we understand less about those persons born to Jewish 
                parents who did not choose to depart Castro's sovietized Cuba.<sup>3</sup> 
                The dwindling colony of elderly practicing Jews is known about, 
                of course, in part through the efforts of foreign Jewish welfare 
                agencies to assist them and in part because the Castro government 
                earmarked them for compassionate treatment. We know less about 
                those assimilated and secular individuals who stopped considering 
                themselves Jews, or who converted to other religions, or who dropped 
                away, because maintaining religious affiliation under the dictatorship 
                brought job discrimination, surveillance, and in some cases imprisonment.</p>
              <p> When the immigrants arrived in the early years of the twentieth 
                century there was no host community to greet them. Just as elsewhere 
                in the region, the few Jews who had come to Cuba earlier had been 
                almost entirely absorbed by their host societies; even though 
                the early twentieth century witnessed several waves of Jewish 
                arrivals, the numbers were overshadowed by other migrant populations, 
                especially from the various regions of Spain but also from Jamaica, 
                the Arab Middle East, China, and elsewhere. Jews totalled slightly 
                more than one percent of the national population only in Argentina 
                and Uruguay; in Cuba and the rest of Latin America, where a total 
                of a quarter million Jews immigrated from the Old World, the Jewish 
                population still never approached one percent of the whole. Furthermore, 
                outmigration of Jews from Cuba as well from Latin America in general 
                always exceeded outmigration from the United States or Western 
                Europe, and more Jews from Latin America (although not Cuba) resettled 
                in the State of Israel than from any other part of the Diaspora.<sup>4</sup></p>
              <p> From the scholarly point of view, serious work on Cuban Jewish 
                history remains in its infancy. There is no detailed overall study 
                of Jews in Cuba; nor do we agree upon the boundaries and parameters 
                of that population. Even the word "community"--as in "Jewish community"--is 
                fraught with inaccuracy. Close study reveals that at least until 
                the late 1950s, persons of Jewish origin in Cuba in most cases 
                remained identified with inclusive groups: Sephardics, Ashkenazics, 
                "American" Jews, German-speaking refugees from Nazism, and even 
                smaller subdivisions within those categories. Before the end of 
                the war, Cuban Jewry was even more fractious--people saw themselves 
                as Belgian-Polish Jews, or Polish Jews, or Moroccan Jews, or English-language 
                speaking American Jews, or Alsatian Jews, or Turkish Jews. By 
                the time the distinctions began to blur with intermarriage, Fidel 
                Castro's and his revolutionaries were already carrying out maneuvers 
                in the mountains. Nor did Cuba's Jews form a "community" after 
                the Revolution, because the large majority of those who identified 
                themselves as Jews assimilated or departed, leaving small pockets 
                of mostly elderly men and women who still thought of themselves 
                as Sephardim or Ashkenazim and who really did not mingle. </p>
              <p>In 1989, only 685 persons in Cuba publicly claimed to be Jews, 
                and of these only 445, or 70 percent, were born to Jewish mothers. 
                In the early 1990s, even some of these men and women departed, 
                coming to the United States or to Israel. But clearly other individuals 
                of Jewish background remained on the island, having personally 
                opted for assimilation. These former Jews merit study as well, 
                especially in the light of the historical truth that sometimes 
                regimes come to power that reject assimilation retroactively.</p>
              <p> An even more knotty problem is the question of who should be 
                counted as a Jew in the first place. Two tendencies coexisted, 
                in some ways contradictory. The first was the practice of Jewish 
                religious and fraternal organizations to include as Jews only 
                those who remained affiliated, passing over, therefore, the thousands 
                of individuals who had been born Jewish but who had drifted away 
                in secularism or who had married into Roman Catholic families 
                and were therefore written off as Jews. The second inclination, 
                found, not only in Cuba, has been the tendency to stretch the 
                truth and to exaggerate. There are dozens of studies that argue 
                that Columbus's crew members, and even Columbus himself, were 
                secret Jews. For the twentieth century, figures exaggerate the 
                numbers of Jews in Cuba, making the "community" seem more numerous 
                than it probably was. Ironically, because the two tendencies tended 
                to balance one another, the figures for the number of Jews in 
                Cuba on the eve of the 1959 Revolution were likely accurate, although 
                they omitted thousands of persons who had been born Jewish, or 
                half-Jewish, but who had abandoned (or been stripped) of their 
                Jewish communal identity.</p>
              <p> Another problem in trying to pinpoint the exact number of Jews 
                in Cuba was that during the 1920s and 1930s, many persons of Jewish 
                origin secretly and illegally departed Cuba for Mexico or Puerto 
                Rico or directly for the United States. These individuals, mostly 
                men who had been turned away from the United States by the quota 
                system imposed in 1924, learned through the grapevine that it 
                was possible to get a visa to Mexico and then cross the border 
                into the United States, or to claim relatives in the United States 
                and therefore be permitted to enter the United States even if 
                the relationship was contrived. Some men married American women 
                through intermediaries via mail order as another way to enter 
                the "Golden Medina." I estimate that as many as one-third of the 
                Jews who came to Cuba from Europe between 1924 and the Second 
                World War snuck into the United States in this manner. Since their 
                actions were illegal, they naturally would not have been picked 
                up by the standard ways of counting Jewish persons who came and 
                went.</p>
              <p> <font color="#000080"><b>The Task:</b></font></p>
              <p> Studying any ethnic or religious group is always a difficult 
                undertaking. Community leaders seem to feel obliged to wave flags 
                and emphasize the brightest spots in the community, to boost the 
                community's image. Elderly and poor people, when interviewed, 
                have no reason to exaggerate; the stories of their hard lives 
                tell the truth as they experienced it. Between the groups at the 
                top and at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder, fall most 
                people, jockeying to improve their lives, wrestling with the ups 
                and downs of family life. In Cuba, this was complemented by the 
                need to learn how the system worked. Most Jews in Cuba, more in 
                cities than in the countryside, rarely experienced any more direct 
                anti-Semitism than, say, their counterparts in the United States 
                or Canada during the 1930s and 1940s. But Cuban society was more 
                closed to them, and they had to learn what avenues were blocked 
                to them (government jobs, banking, heavy industry, the legal profession, 
                journalism) and which were permitted (manufacturing and retailing, 
                souvenir shops, and, by the 1950s, pharmacy, dentistry, and architecture).</p>
              <p> The story of Cuba's Jews needs to be told on many levels. Modern 
                Israelis seem to be able to do this well, perhaps better than 
                the rest of us. Consider the 1998 novel, <i>The One Facing Us</i>, 
                by Ronit Matalon.<sup>5</sup> The story of a young journalist 
                named Zuza who seeks to probe her family's complicated past, the 
                novel seems to mock the attempts by well-meaning Jews to romanticize 
                the diaspora experienced by their parents and grandparents. Zuza's 
                seeks to simplify and to romanticize, refusing to construct a 
                "colorful," "dramatic, and "deceptively simple" story of the Jewish 
                past, but Matalon, the author, does not permit her to get away 
                with this.<sup>6</sup></p>
              <p> We must fill in the shadows. We must ask questions that we have 
                not asked because they did not occur to us because of the way 
                we have relied on only one of several possible definitions of 
                who fits within the boundaries of the Jewish population and who 
                does not. We also need to identify the strategies employed by 
                many foreigners in Cuba either to accommodate to the system or 
                to fight it. I know of a family whose Hungarian-speaking father 
                came to Cuba from Transylvania in 1936 at the age of 17; he and 
                his wife devoted their energies to improving their lot. Unable 
                to leave permanently after the war, the family's mother travelled 
                to the United States during her pregnancy so that her child would 
                be born in the United States and have the advantage of American 
                citizenship. As it turned out, Fidel Castro solved the family's 
                problem for it when he nationalized the father's clothing factory 
                in 1961; after a sojourn in Venezuela, like so many others they 
                were admitted as refugees to the United States, the country that 
                for decades had refused to accept them as emigres.</p>
              <p> Many areas merit further research. How did the Jewish economic 
                universe within Cuba function? How did networking function? What 
                was the dynamic of Jews working for Jews? Were Cuban Jews able 
                to obtain loans from banks or did they have to continue borrowing 
                informally from within the Jewish colony? How did Jewish Cubans 
                interact with their neighbors? What happened when a Jew married 
                a Catholic, or when he or she ended his communal affiliations? 
                Were they still considered Jews by Cubans who would use the excuse 
                to persist in labeling them outsiders? What was it about Cuban 
                society that permitted the children of a Jewish father and a Catholic 
                mother to be raised as Catholics and therefore take their place 
                as insiders in Cuban life? What factors influenced the ways Cuban 
                Jews in South Florida and in other places of refuge related to 
                the Cuban émigré movement, dominated by right-wing politics and 
                unrelenting militancy? How did they behave? Were the old divisions 
                maintained or did they melt with the passing of time. Did the 
                Jewish Cubans assimilate to a greater or a lesser degree than 
                their Catholic compatriots? Did young people in the Cuban-Jewish-American 
                population stay within their group, or did they marry non-Jews 
                to the degree that their American-born Jews did, a figure hovering 
                around fifty percent?<sup>7</sup></p>
              <p> People frequently invent myths about themselves and about the 
                stories of their lives and then not only come to believe them 
                but to embellish them with imagined memory. This is a complex 
                process, mixing fact with wishful thinking. Elderly Jews in Cuba 
                often spoke fondly of their black servants, saying that so and 
                so was "part of the family," an intimation of kinship not borne 
                out in most cases by social and economic reality although in Cuba 
                individual families often related closely to servants and sometimes 
                provided assistance to their children for schooling or medical 
                care. It is natural and even healthy, of course, to remember good 
                things and not to dwell on misfortune. Many Jewish Cubans wax 
                nostalgic about the good old days, remembering with pride the 
                community's activities during the 1930s and especially after World 
                War II. Communal organizations and charities thrived, and Jews 
                felt prosperous and secure. Some remember how friendly Cuban officials 
                were, even the police, as long as they accommodated to the live-and-let-live 
                Cuban system.</p>
              <p> Ruth Behar has observed that the most exciting thinking in her 
                discipline of anthropology is currently taking place on the border 
                between subjective and objective knowledge. Scholars must step 
                gingerly when addressing issues of vulnerability, and frailty, 
                and economic exploitation. Behar has shown that the investigator 
                herself becomes a "vulnerable observer," drawn into an emotional 
                relationship with her sources, and hard pressed to step back and 
                maintain the effort to be unemotional and scientific.<sup>8</sup></p>
              <p> To move beyond the limitations of most of the writing on Jews 
                in 20th-century Cuba, we need to probe the subject in greater 
                precision and depth. It is urgent that new oral histories along 
                the lines of those conducted by Margalit Bejarano be conducted.<sup>9</sup></p>
              <p> This must be done sooner, not later, because of the advanced 
                age of many potential interview subjects. Scholars must get beneath 
                the surface. What were the internal dynamics of Jewish life? To 
                what extent and in what manner did the leaders of the Jewish colony 
                interact with their counterparts in the Cuban elite? How much 
                money was invested in Cuba and how much was transferred abroad, 
                especially to the United States. What was the relationship of 
                the Cuban Jewish colony to the establishment and maintenance of 
                the State of Israel? What role did Jews play in communist groups 
                and labor unions before and after 1959? What was the Cuban Jewish 
                contribution to science and culture? What plans were made to facilitate 
                emigration in the first days of the Revolution when stories about 
                Raul Castro's anti-semitism and Fidel Castro's warnings about 
                expropriation of private property began to spread? What happened 
                after 1959 to the thousands of persons born Jewish but who had 
                personally abandoned that status who stayed behind in Cuba? What 
                have been the nature of relations between the Cuban Jews who went 
                abroad and those who stayed at home? What lessons does the history 
                of Jews in Cuba provide about assimilation, acculturation, ethnic 
                and religious survival, accommodation, resistance, and so many 
                other themes underlying life in Cuban society?</p>

                Review, August 9, 1998, 9. One step in the right direction was 
                the publication of the difficult story of the <i>Altalena,</i> 
                a ship carrying eight young Cuban-Jewish volunteers along with 
                dozens more from the U.S. and Great Britain to Palestine to fight 
                for the independence of the State of Israel. Because of a dispute 
                between Menachim Begin's Irgun and David Ben Gurion's Haganah, 
                Ben Gurion ordered the ship fired upon to prevent it from entering 
                Tel Aviv harbor. One of the Cuban Jews, a medical student from 
                the University of Havana named David Levy, was killed. The story 
                is important because it offers a sad but important antidote to 
                the tendency to write history in black and white, obscuring the 
                nuances that in this case existed to the point that some Jews 
                killed other Jews during the Zionist struggle for Israel, something 
                rarely admitted in history books. </font></p>
