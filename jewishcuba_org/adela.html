        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Adela Dworin, Vice 
          President of Casa de la Comunidad Hebrea de Cuba</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">If Dr. Jose Miller 
          is the pillar off strength providing support for the Cuban Jewish community, 
          Adela Dworin is the dynamo of energy that keeps everything running. 
          For several days I tried to get time with Adela for a sit-down interview, 
          but each time we made arrangements something came up to divert her. 
          Synagogue groups from all of the world drop by and want to be taken 
          on a tour. Individuals from the world's Jewish communities wander in 
          the door, curious and inquisitive about what they have found. Scholars, 
          children, food providers, travel arrangers, and more all gravitate to 
          Adela to have their problems solved. She takes them all in with patience 
          and good humor. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She also takes 
          time to take care of the needs of members of the community. She is their 
          confidante, the source of medicines when the pharmacy is closed, and 
          the person with the key to the closet full of clothing and other supplies.</font> 
        </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In 1924 Adela's 
          father left Pinsk, now in Belarus, intending to go to the United States. 
          Like many Jews of that time, his route was through the Caribbean (see 
          Robert Levine's &quot;<a href="levine.html">Tropical Diaspora</a>&quot;), 
          and he ended up in Cuba. He could not afford a visa to the States, and 
          became a peddler. As Adela tells the story, in 1930 a young woman who 
          has destined to be Adela's mother left Pinsk en route to Cuba. She carried 
          letters to a young man (who would eventually be Adela's father) </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">from 
          her town living in Cuba. They met at the Pinsk Union in Havana, the 
          letters were delivered, they fell in love, and got married. <img src="art09.jpg" width="320" height="214" align="left" vspace="6" hspace="8"></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Adela was raised 
          in an Orthodox home, and grew up speaking Yiddish. &quot;My grandmother 
          never learned Spanish,&quot; she says, &quot;so I had to communicate 
          with her in Yiddish.&quot; She attended the Jewish elementary school 
          in Havana. Her father opened a small store, and by 1959 he had a big 
          factory. Then, as Adela says, &quot;He lost everything.&quot; In spite 
          of the losses the family stayed in Cuba, and her father got a job with 
          the government. Although the government at that time was officially 
          atheistic, Adela's father insisted that his family do volunteer work 
          in the Jewish Center, which had been built in 1953. Adela says that 
          during those years, &quot;Many leaders did not come to the synagogue.&quot; 
          Persons thought to be religious could not find good employment, so choices 
          had to be made. Adela worked in the Jewish Center library, and says 
          that it was mostly used by non-Jews and the elderly. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In her 30 years 
          of work at the Jewish Center, Adela has seen many changes. In 1981, 
          after 90 percent of Cuba's Jewish population moved to the United States, 
          Argentina, and other countries, the government said that the mortgage 
          on the Jewish Center had to be paid. The ten percent of the remaining 
          population could not afford this, so a part of the building was sold 
          to the Ministry of Culture, and is now a theater and a cafeteria.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Adela also remembers 
          the 25th anniversary of the founding of Israel. &quot;We had a big cake 
          with a flag of Israel on it,&quot; she says. &quot;We also took this 
          occasion to remember those lost in the Holocaust. But we had to do this 
          in secret, and only a few of us participated.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In 1991 Cuba's 
          government policy changed from being an &quot;atheist&quot; state to 
          a &quot;secular&quot; state, and people started returning to the synagogues 
          and churches. &quot;If you had asked me twelve years ago if Judaism 
          would be revived in Cuba, I would probably have told you no,&quot; says 
          Adela. &quot;I thought the community would just disappear. But now we 
          have a minyan on Friday night, and 50 or 60 people attending the Sunday 
          schools.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This attendance 
          is helped by a liberal policy on who is Jewish. &quot;If they want to 
          be active, they are accepted,&quot; says Adela, a statement which would 
          cause some consternation in more Orthodox Jewish circles. But Cuban 
          Judaism exhibits an ancient Jewish flexibility, and the labels of othodox, 
          conservative, and reform are not rigidly applied.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Adela keeps a kosher 
          home, which is difficult in a country which lives to a great extent 
          on ham and cheese sandwiches. &quot;My grandmother taught me the kosher 
          laws,&quot; says Adela, &quot;and it is difficult but not impossible.&quot; 
          Live chickens are taken to the kosher butcher, and Adela faithfully 
          gets her ration of 2.2 pounds of beef a month from the same place. &quot;In 
          restaurants we eat fish and vegetables,&quot; she says.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In recent years 
          there have been substantial changes in the types of visitors coming 
          to the Patronato. &quot;We thought there were no Jewish Americans,&quot; 
          says Adela. &quot;All of our Jewish visitors came from other places. 
          But now, with the JDC, B'nai B'rith, the Cuba-America Jewish Mission 
          and others, we have a lot of U.S. visitors.&quot; Adela is proud to 
          give these visitors a tour, taking in the library, the synagogue, the 
          pharmacy, the computer center, and the general surroundings of the Patronato.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Adela remains in 
          charge of the library, who now has over ten thousand books, two thousand 
          of these in Yiddish. Many of the books are over 50 years old. &quot;Young 
          people prefer computers,&quot; Adela says, &quot;so we are losing our 
          library readers to the upstairs computer center.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">But then Adela 
          looks up and smiles. &quot;But the important thing is that they want 
          to come to the synagogue,&quot; she says. &quot;They love to stay late, 
          and socialize, and talk. Our community is coming back to life.&quot;</font></p>
