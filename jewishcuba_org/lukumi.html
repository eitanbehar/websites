                <p><font face="Century Schoolbook"><b><i>Existing Situation</i></b></font></p>
                <p><font face="Century Schoolbook" size=2>Religious organizations 
                  donating medicine in Cuba give a large portion to the government. 
                  Only a small part of the medicine reaches the people in need. 
                  In many instances the donations serve as tools intended to draw 
                  converts. The government in turn keeps a portion for free distribution 
                  and the other is sold to supply the needs of tourist.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Century Schoolbook" size=2>Millions of dollars 
                  worth of medicine are sent yearly from family members in the 
                  exile community. They pay the high cost of medicine at their 
                  local pharmacy. To ship the medicine they must go to a licensed 
                  agency and pay up to fifteen ($15.00) dollars per pound. United 
                  States law limits the shipments of medicine to two-hundred ($200) 
                  dollars monthly. Another option is to send limited US dollars 
                  and the relative in Cuba can try to buy his or her needs from 
                  government stores. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Century Schoolbook" size=2>Hermandad Lukumi is 
                  a Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye (CLBA) humanitarian relief 
                  program. CLBA is the religious organization promoting the donation 
                  of medicine to family members in the exile community. Joining 
                  our program are numerous nongovernmental charities in Europe. 
                  This is an apolitical independent Lukumi program for humanitarian 
                  relief purposes only. CLBA will maintain that all donations 
                  are to be delivered directly to needy recipients through the 
                  petition of a family member in the USA and abroad. </font><font face="Century Schoolbook" size=2></font></p>
                <p><font face="Century Schoolbook" size=2>The system of delivery 
                  is courier service. All licensed courier agencies to Cuba can 
                  participate in this program to implement delivery procedure. 
                  Approval of donations is a sole right of CLBA. Participating 
                  agencies must maintain a fixed shipping rate of $7.00 per pound 
                  without any additional charges. Agencies and CLBA guarantee 
                  100% replacement of donation(s) and shipping charge(s) in cases 
                  of lost delivery. </font><font face="Century Schoolbook" size=2></font></p>
                <p><font face="Century Schoolbook" size=2>CLBA will maintain a 
                  humanist, not discriminatory policy on donations. Donations 
                  are to be given directly into the hands of every recipient regardless 
                  of religious belief or atheist. There will be no political slogans 
                  or religious propaganda seeking converts using techniques for 
                  psychological coercion. </font></p>
