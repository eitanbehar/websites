              <h2>In Cuba, a clash between religions</h2>
              <p><font size=+1><b><i>Afro-Cuban creeds, Catholics at odds</i></b></font> 
              </p>
              <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=-1><b>By JUAN O. TAMAYO </b></font><br>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=-1>Herald Staff Writer</font> 
              </p>
              <p> In a clash over Cuba's religious image, leaders of Afro-Cuban 
                creeds are complaining the Catholic Church has launched an offensive 
                against them on the eve of Pope John Paul II's visit. 
              <p> Catholics have branded them "pseudo religions," the Afro-Cuban 
                leaders say, excluded them from meetings with the pope and rejected 
                their offer of a drumming rite of welcome for the pontiff in Havana's 
                cathedral. 
              <p> Cardinal Jaime Ortega has denied attacking the religions and 
                said he's only criticizing efforts, by the communist government, 
                to promote Afro-Cuban rites as an alternative to Catholicism and 
                a tourism draw. 
              <p> "It gives me great pain that for propaganda and business reasons 
                . . . there are attempts to split" Afro-Cuban believers away from 
                Catholicism, Ortega told the church magazine Truth and Hope in 
                a recent interview 
              <p> "These brothers know . . . the church has always welcomed them 
                with Christian Love," he added. "The offensive, if there is one, 
                is not against those brothers but against those who aim to split 
                them away." 
              <p> Such words have not soothed leaders of the religions brought 
                to Cuba by African slaves -- Santeria, Palo Monte and Abakua -- 
                who complain that Cuba's Catholic hierarchy is out to attack and 
                marginalize them. 
              <p> "As far back as October, the church has been more publicly verbal 
                in its anti-Santeria positions," said Ricardo Guerra, a Havana 
                Santeria babalawo, or priest, who talked to Ortega after a Mass 
                last Tuesday. 
              <p> Catholics claim to be the largest religion in Cuba, with 4.2 
                million baptized members. Afro-Cuban rites have a strong following, 
                but one harder to quantify because they lack institutional organization. 
              <p> "I told Ortega we simply wanted to know why they excluded us" 
                from the pontiff's Jan. 25 meeting with leaders of Cuba's Protestant, 
                Jewish and Catholic faiths, Guerra said in a phone conversation. 
              <p> "The cardinal said the meeting is for Christians only, but that 
                he would try to meet us after the pope's trip," Guerra said. Told 
                that Jews are not Christians, he seemed surprised. "You see? It's 
                just us." 
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=-1><b>Not taken seriously</b></font> 
              <p> Afro-Cuban religious leaders also pointed to past comments by 
                Ortega, who has referred to the faiths as "pseudo religions," 
                and Havana Msgr. Jaime Gaitan, who has said that Santeria "lowers 
                man to mediocrity." 
              <p> "There are academics who believe Santeria is an official religion. 
                It would seem that our culture was African . . . and that this 
                would be the only way to express religiosity," Gaitan said in 
                a homily in September. 
              <p> Behind such comments is the belief by Cuban Catholics that the 
                communist government has long favored Afro-Cuban religions as 
                a political counterweight to Catholicism and a lucrative tourist 
                attraction. 
              <p> Although President Fidel Castro favored Santeria in his first 
                years in power as the religion of Cuba's black and poor, his government 
                began stifling all religions when it declared itself communist 
                and atheist in 1962. 
              <p> But in 1978, the government began promoting several Afro-Cuban 
                babalawos, friendly to the regime, as folkloric attractions for 
                foreigners who paid in hard currency, said Havana Santeria expert 
                Natalia Bolivar. 
              <p> They were the so-called "diplo-babalawos," who charged for their 
                services in U.S. dollars, just like the government "diplo-stores" 
                that sell imported goods to foreign diplomats in dollars. 
              <p> The government kept most of the dollars, Bolivar said, from 
                the $15,000 that a Spanish TV station once paid to film a half-hour 
                ceremony to the $1,000 that babalawos charged to initiate visiting 
                foreigners into the secrets of their religions. 
              <p> Those babalawos also put on special "ceremonies" for foreigners, 
                including some with bare-breasted women dancers who went into 
                "trances," and eventually drew strong protests from serious believers. 
              <p> Government tourism offices, meanwhile, promoted the Afro-Cuban 
                religions in their advertising abroad, giving the impression that 
                Santeria and not Catholicism was the island's dominant religion, 
              <p> "For years this government has promoted Santeria as a virtual 
                official religion, giving oxygen to friendly babalawos to earn 
                tourist dollars while trying to asphyxiate the church," said one 
                Havana priest. 
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=-1><b>A more defined faith</b></font> 
              <p> But with Catholics growing in strength as Castro eased restrictions 
                in advance of the pope's visit, the priest added, church leaders 
                decided it was time to push their own dogma, embracing all Afro-Cuban 
                believers who accept Catholic leadership while distancing the 
                rest. 
              <p> "It seems to me the church has decided that it wants people 
                to be more defined in their faith, less willing to mix their Catholicism 
                with Santeria," said Ernesto Pichardo, president of Hialeah's 
                Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye. 
              <p> "They are pushing for the people to be fully converted to Catholicism, 
                and not be mixing religions," added Natalia Bolivar, both an academic 
                expert and believer in Afro-Cuban religions. 
              <p> Catholic relations with the Afro-Cuban religions have always 
                been uneasy because of their tenuous common ground -- Catholic 
                practices adopted by the Afro-Cubans long ago to hide their African 
                roots from slave masters. 
              <p> Ortega has recently sidelined the Rev. Carlos Manuel de Cespedes, 
                a former Havana vicar and liberal who long advocated Catholic 
                tolerance of Afro-Cuban religions and followers. 
              <p> But even the leaders of Afro-Cuban religions themselves do not 
                agree on their relationship with Catholicism. 
              <p> Many babalawos insist that theirs is a "syncretic" religion, 
                a mixture of African and Catholic beliefs. That is why some of 
                the Afro-Cuban gods known as Orishas also have Catholic equivalents 
                such as the Virgin Mary. 
              <p> "I have been Catholic since birth, and I demand that all my 
                followers are baptized in the church before I initiate them," 
                said Miguel Angel Plasencia, a 47-year-old Santeria priest in 
                Havana. 
              <p> But some purists argue that Afro-Cuban rites should be considered 
                independent, fully formed religions that only took on some of 
                the trappings of Catholicism to protect themselves. 
              <p> "These are not syncretic religions," said Bolivar. "They are 
                separate religions, but they make use of Catholicism and send 
                their people to fill Catholic churches." </p>
