                      male was quite a catch for a Cuban synagogue, they admitted. 
                      I'm not very religious, I countered, in fact I can't even

                      Year's services at one synagogue in the evening and at the 
                      other the following morning, I wrote a shiksita back in 
                      the States. I don't think this is why I came here; still, 
                      it's a legitimate slice of Cuban life and they're really 
                      very nice people. I must admit I did laugh to myself a little 
                      when each, on the same day, implored me to come to their 
                      services. For one brief moment, I was the hottest Jew in 
                      Havana. </font></p>

                      English, and Yiddish. "Have you been brissed?" He made snip-snip 
                      motions with his fingers. "What was your father's name?" 
                      Morris, which he took to be Moishe. "What was your mother's 
                      surname?" Levy. "So you're Jewish!" With that he fetched 
                      a prayer shawl and draped it over my shoulders. "You'll

                    <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">I started to pull out my notepad. 
                      The snip-snip man admonished me. "Don't take notes. You 
                      can do that afterward when we gather downstairs to eat." 
                      He invoked the Fourth Commandment about keeping the Sabbath 
                      holy as his authority, then gravitated to the front, where 
                      he got into a heated argument with the lay rabbi over Hebrew 
                      pronunciation. The quarrel ended as abruptly as it had begun. 
                      The man in front of me looked up from his newspaper. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Each worshipper was called 
                      to the front to read a brief portion of the Torah and hold 
                      it for the next reader. Snip-snip bellowed out from the 
                      front, "Tom, ben-Moishe, please come up to the Holy Scrolls."

                      on top of the Torah at my excerpt, underlined with an elaborate

                      could pronounce my portion. Afterward we wished each other 
                      a happy New Year with gefilte fish, bread, and cake. In 
                      our blessing we thanked God for Tropicola. </font></p>

              said in English, "You don't see many yarmulkes around here." Startled, 
              he replied, "Are you Jewish?" He was an extremely Orthodox Jew, 
              in Havana for a few days staying at a tourist hotel. He invited 
              me to drop by later that evening. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">In his room I asked what he did for 
              a living. "Let's just say I have a degree in electrical engineering." 
              He looked up at the ceiling. "They have a very lively smoke detector 
              in this room." He implied that he works under contract to the State 
              Department conducting routine electronic sweeps of overseas embassies. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">He assumed his room was bugged. "I 
              went to my rabbi about that. You know, under Jewish law it's forbidden 
              to use electrical equipment on the Sabbath. I've sometimes found 
              myself in situations where I knew I was speaking into a microphone 
              on the Sabbath." He glanced up at the smoke detector. "I was very 
              concerned that I was violating Jewish law. My rabbi said it was 
              all right, that God understood I wasn't violating any of his commandments." 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">The debugger had a consuming interest 
              in Cuba's Jewish community. "I've only seen official Havana. I'm 
              not allowed to travel around town unless I'm with another person 
              from the States. Regulations." He eats devoutly kosher, and packs 
              not only his own food, but also cooking utensils, silverware, and 
              serving dishes. Also tapes of Israeli music, Bibles, wine, a hot 
              plate, soup mix, gefilte fish, salami, black bread; the whole shmear.

            <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">"When I go to another country I always 
              travel with a suitcaseful of extra things to give to Jews who can 
              use them." He practiced tzedakah, the Jewish act of charity, a trait 
              taught in the Torah. He spread his traveling offerings out on the 
              bed. "I'm leaving on the flight tomorrow. Do you think the community 
              here could use any of this?" he asked, pointing to the treasure. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">My jaw hung open and I slapped my 
              cheek. "Could they use any of it? This stuff would be more welcomed 
              than the Messiah!" In five minutes he loaded me down with enough 
              chozzerai to stock a Hadassah flea market. "Just don't tell them
