                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">When Castro came to power in 1959, 
                  the Jewish population of Cuba numbered 15,000. Though most have 
                  since emigrated, the remaining Jews have had an uncertain fate. 
                  In the 1990s, there is a resurgence of custom and belief among 
                  the Cuban Jews. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">The film opens with scenes of 
                  the Jewish cemetery, the ghosts of which haunt and give shape 
                  to the film. </font><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Abraham, a 
                  middle-aged man who remembers better times, lives in Havana, 
                  a city with a great Jewish presence. Wanting to maintain his 
                  traditions, Abraham lovingly prepares his son for his bar mitzvah, 
                  the first such event in Cuba in 15 years. </font><font face="Arial" size="-1"> 
                  Eugenia lives in a smaller city. She was brought up in a strict 
                  Jewish manner, with her dead father's wish to see his daughter 
                  marry a Jew. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">With few potential Jewish husbands 
                  to choose from, Eugenia finally marries an understanding Cuban. 
                  Their two daughters are being raised in the Jewish faith. Without 
                  a synagogue, Eugenia has to piece the tradition together in 
                  part from stories her father told her. </font><font face="Arial" size="-1"> 
                  This is a very thoughtful film, easy to view with its large 
                  English subtitles. It is recommended for school and public libraries 
                  that emphasize Jewish, Latin American, or ethnic studies.</font></p>
