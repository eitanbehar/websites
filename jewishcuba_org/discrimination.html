                    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 
                      government will reinstate home-buying grants for immigrants 
                      from four countries - <b>Argentina, Uruguay, France and 
                      South Africa</b> - the state will tell the High Court of

                    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Israel 
                      Radio reported Thursday, however, that the concession, which 
                      comes in response to a petition by the Jewish Agency and 
                      various immigrant associations against the cancellation 
                      of the grants on April 14, will only last for six months.

                    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Until 
                      April 14, immigrants were entitled to both grants and loans 
                      when buying apartments, but on that date the grants were 
                      canceled and replaced by loans. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As 
                      a result, many immigrants' mortgage payments rose by dozens 
                      or even hundreds of percent. Immigrants from these four 
                      countries were particularly affected, because they are entitled 
                      to larger grants than all other immigrants except Ethiopians, 
                      for whom the government has already arranged compensation.

                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I 
                  do not question the need for Israel to take stringent measures 
                  to improve its economy. I do not question the need to make an 
                  exception for Argentinian and Uruguayan Jews. Their countries 
                  are in desperate financial circumstances, and immigrants from 
                  these two countries have little support from home.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">What 
                  I do question is the inclusion of South Africa and France, while 
                  Cuba is excluded. The reasons for this decision are unclear, 
                  but probably involve a lack of protexia by Cubans, and substantial 
                  political clout by the Jewish Agency on behalf of the others. 
                  </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">But 
                  why Cubans? Are they considered wealthy immigrants? The reality 
                  is that Cuban Jews arrive in Israel with approximately $20 given 
                  by the Jewish Agency, and a few clothes in a small bag. No containers, 
                  no money from sold properties, nothing. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">South 
                  Africans? I've lived in South Africa. My oldest daughter is 
                  South African. Finding a poor Jew in South Africa is like finding 
                  a homeless person in Norway. They may be there, but no one remembers 
                  when they last saw one.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 
                  French? To consider French Jewry as economically needy, and 
                  to say that French olim have no support from home, takes great 
                  imagination. Historically the French have demonstrated strong, 
                  supportive family affiliations, and France is not a poor country. 
                  </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">So 
                  why is the Israeli government discriminating against Cuban Jews? 
                  Why are Cuban Jews, with limited resources but great courage, 
                  not fully welcomed into Israeli society? Why does the government 
                  send them the message, &quot;The French and South Africans, 
                  although more wealthy, need more help than you do?&quot; Why 
                  does the government tell the Cubans, &quot;We don't want you 
                  to buy a home?&quot;</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 
                  Jewish olim from Cuba, who have lived for decades in an oppressive 
                  religious environment, deserve better treatment than this.</font></p>
