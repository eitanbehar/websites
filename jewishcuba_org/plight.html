        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Reprinted

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Tourist Cuba is 
          a bit like a time-machine ride through a Cold War theme park. Vintage 
          Detroit autos rumble past charming Havana hotels refurbished to their 
          pre-revolutionary glory. Posters for featured movies at a film festival 
          keep company with ones that blare slogans like, "La Revolucion Siempre," 
          or the revolution always.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yet, when Roe Gruber 
          and her daughter took a Havana apartment for a month last summer, the 
          Tustin residents were able to escape the tourist cocoon. They learned 
          new skills, like coping with Third World shortages by offering bribes 
          for tomatoes and theater tickets. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Along the way, 
          they were warmly welcomed by an anemic population of 1,300 Jews, who 
          after 40 years only recently have been permitted to resuscitate religious 
          practices without risk of political stigma. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In a nation of 
          11 million, where a physician earns $25 a month and government-owned 
          housing is left to decay, among the worst off are elderly Jews, most 
          of them refugees from Nazi oppression and without surviving relatives 
          for outside support. They scrape by in crumbling apartments on $3-a-month 
          pensions and ration cards for food and clothing. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Such privations 
          ignited a passion in Gruber, whose parents were Holocaust survivors. 
          "Any of those women could have been my grandma," she said. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Like Dina Nudelfunden, 
          78, who prizes the 1953 Coldspot refrigerator in her kitchen, equipped 
          with a one-burner stove. She spends two hours each day commuting for 
          a hot meal served at her Orthodox synagogue, one of five in Havana. 
          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She was overjoyed 
          when Gruber and her daughter, Daniella, delivered a sackful of groceries 
          and $10. "You would have thought I gave her gold," Gruber said. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Or Eva Nissembaum, 
          78, who shares two cinderblock rooms with three brothers. One is Maximo, 
          69, a victim of childhood polio, who cannot leave the apartment because 
          his wheelchair is broken. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Since her first 
          venture to Cuba three years ago, Gruber, by trade a travel agent who 
          specializes in exotic locations, has organized a tzedakah (charity) 
          project that is unusual on several counts. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Aid for religious, 
          humanitarian or educational purposes is permitted into Cuba for nonprofit 
          groups that apply for a federally sanctioned license. Gruber established 
          the Sephardic Friendship Committee, so-named assuming the origin of 
          Cuba's Jews - wrongly as it turned out, since many of Cuba's Jews immigrated 
          from Ashkenazic countries. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Advertising lures 
          fellow travelers who are each expected to schlep 20 pounds in donated 
          food, clothing and medical supplies that Gruber collects. Some are also 
          persuaded that they have acquired disabilities requiring the need of 
          a wheelchair. Miraculously, they always leave Cuba cured and are forced 
          to jettison their wheelchairs - a precious commodity in a nation where 
          food is rationed and medicine is scarce. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After a 1998 papal 
          visit to Cuba, Fidel Castro lifted the ban on organized religion imposed 
          when he seized power in 1959. Soon after, details emerged about a quiet 
          exodus to Israel of 400 Cuban Jews underway since 1995. Israel's Jewish 
          Agency made a deal with Castro for silence, in return for obstacle-free 
          emigration, the report said. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Before the revolution, 
          Cuba's Jewish population was 15,000, supporting five synagogues, three 
          Jewish elementary schools and a network of cultural, social and Zionist 
          groups. The Balkan wars of 1910 had brought a steady stream of Jewish 
          exiles from Turkey. Impoverished Polish and Romanian Jews arrived after 
          World War I. And a third wave of immigrants fled Europe in the 1930s. 
          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In Castro's Cuba, 
          though, the tide of emigres reversed direction. Havana's largest synagogue 
          fell into disrepair, its ceiling missing tiles and birds flying through 
          broken windows. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Today, 150 younger, 
          middle-class families flock to the repaired sanctuary of the Reform 
          synagogue, which doubles as a Jewish Community Center and pharmacy, 
          all known as the Patronato. In the absence of a rabbi, Dr. Jose Miller, 
          a retired surgeon, is its leader. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A photo on its 
          wall shows Miller posing with Castro, who attended a 1998 Chanukah party 
          at Miller's invitation. Visiting rabbis perform conversions of the many 
          non-Jewish spouses, giving the tropical Diaspora a multiethnic mix. 
          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"They had not been 
          allowed to be Jewish openly. Now, they are really excited about it," 
          Gruber said. "It's not taken for granted." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Last June, she 
          informally started a Cuba fund drive at her Conservative synagogue, 
          Tustin's Congregation B'nai Israel, and her daughter's school, Irvine's 
          Tarbut V'Torah. Her goal was $3,600, enough to double the annual income 
          for each of 30 elderly Jews. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"That's not what 
          happened," she said. "It was amazing." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Gruber ended up 
          with $6,000 and is now considering how to expand the committee's support 
          beyond food staples to assist the elderly with home repairs. She returned 
          to Cuba last month to meet with Miller, who plays a role in distributing 
          charity. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Gruber and her 
          15-year-old daughter took a fourth-floor walk-up apartment while enrolled 
          at the University of Havana in an intensive Spanish-language course. 
          Gruber wanted to see the Jewish community from the inside. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">At Havana's 400-bed 
          Children's Hospital, she found quality medical care provided by well-educated 
          staff, but a shortage of medicine and equipment. Dr. Sylvia Leone begged 
          her for syringes. On the streets, women would approach Gruber, rubbing 
          their forearms, a signal they were seeking soap. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Cuba is currency 
          starved. After losing an estimated $5.8 billion a year in subsidies 
          from its chief benefactor, the former Soviet Union, Cuba's economic 
          plight grew worse last year because of the worldwide decline in tourism. 
          Clothing rations for each citizen were cut from three articles to none 
          this year. Desperate for dollars, the Cuban government is restoring 
          portions of Havana to lure tourists and loosening rules on foreign charity 
          efforts. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Several other United 
          States-based groups also are intent on aiding Cuban Jews. The Berkeley-based 
          Cuba-America Jewish Mission started as a Hadassah membership drive in 
          1994 and has returned 14 times since, said June Safran, its executive 
          director. "I saw that I could do some good," she said. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The Cuban Jewish 
          Relief Project of B'nai B'rith's Center for Public Policy in Philadelphia 
          estimates it has shipped $3 million in supplies to Cuba over three years. 
          At least six U.S. synagogues have Cuban projects. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">However, some in 
          the Cuban exile community are ambivalent about aid, viewing it as perpetuating 
          a government they oppose. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"One thing we don't 
          advocate is starving," said Dennis K. Hays, a former U.S. ambassador 
          and executive vice president of the Cuban American National Foundation, 
          the oldest and largest exile community. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Well-meaning individuals 
          get pulled into the regime's orbit," Hays said. "With some effort you 
          can get it into the hands of the people." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Hays warned that 
          charitable groups should be suspicious of having to rely on an "official 
          interlocutor." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Our position is 
          we support efforts that help Cuban people," Hays said. "If they are 
          going down and working independently, we would be supportive." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Gruber returned 
          to the United States with a fresh perspective. In the supermarket, the 
          produce manager wondered why she remained rooted in front of a heap 
          of tomatoes. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"It makes you realize 
          there's an imbalance," she said. "We have too much, and they have too 
          little." </font>
