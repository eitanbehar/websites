              <h1>Synagogue feeds physical, spiritual hunger in Santiago</h1>
              <p> <b>LESLEY PEARL</b>
              <p> <b></b><i>Bulletin Staff</i>
              <p> <i></i>
              <p> The Jews of Santiago, Cuba, have always had faith. It reverberates 
                through the barren walls of their newly acquired synagogue in 
                salsa melodies and Hebrew prayers sung with gusto.
              <p> The community's 80 members recently added new songs and chanting 
                skills to their religious repertoire, as well as the blessings 
                before and after meals, and a Tu B'Shevat Haggadah. Their new 
                knowledge and resources were a gift from their sister synagogue 
                -- Congregation Netivot Shalom in Berkeley.
              <p> Twenty people, 14 of them members of the Conservative congregation, 
                recently visited Santiago, at the southeastern tip of Cuba, and 
                Havana.
              <p> Equipped with copies of prayer services, haggadot, books, dried 
                fruit, toilet paper, felt-tipped pens, construction paper, a cup 
                for ritual washing, letters from their children, and a wooden 
                <i>tzedakah</i> box, the group met members of their Cuban sister 
                congregation for the first time last month.
              <p> The Cuban Jews were appreciative of the goods but were really 
                "hungry for a spiritual life and what we could offer them in that 
                way," said Rabbi Stuart Kelman.
              <p> Kelman knew Cuba's Jews, like the rest of its citizens, were 
                suffering since the former Soviet Union stopped financially supporting 
                the country. But he learned of the spiritual needs of Santiago's 
                Conservative congregation, Hatikvah, through one of his own congregants, 
                June Safran. 
              <p> Safran had visited Cuba twice -- once helping to establish a 
                Hadassah chapter in Havana and another time touring the entire 
                country and staying with locals.
              <p> Safran was familiar with the work of the Joint Distribution 
                Committee, assisting with both religious and practical concerns 
                throughout the country. However, she was struck by the particular 
                needs of Santiago's small Jewish community and hoped her own congregation 
                could help.
              <p> Last year Santiago's synagogue -- a long rectangular building 
                with a plain ark, folding chairs, classroom, office and modest 
                kitchen -- was returned by the Cuban government, which had taken 
                over ownership because the congregation could not pay its taxes.
              <p> Despite its hardships,"the community has always been in existence, 
                full of life and passion and energy," Kelman said. "The synagogue 
                is the focal point now."
              <p> Services at Hatikvah are led by laypersons. A traveling rabbi 
                visits from Chile every few months, and the Torah is on loan from 
                another congregation. 
              <p> Although the synagogue badly needs certain amenities, the congregation 
                seems most interested in enhancing their Jewish knowledge, Safran 
                said.
              <p> "Their No.1 need is making a Jewish connection," she said. "Interaction 
                is the most important thing for them." 
              <p> On the trip, Kelman taught the week's Torah portion, the Ten 
                Commandments, while Bay Area congregants worked with the children. 
                The group also addressed pragmatic concerns like how to keep a 
                synagogue financially secure.
              <p> Congregant Jeanne Reisman of Oakland served as the group's translator.
              <p> In addition, the two congregations celebrated a Tu B'Shevat 
                seder, performed an early Purim <i>shpiel</i>, or play, visited 
                the community's remote Jewish cemetery and planted trees there.
              <p> They also agreed to pay for repairs on one of the cemetery walls, 
                which is crumbling. Congregation Beth Abraham in Oakland is assisting 
                in the effort.
              <p> Meanwhile, Hativkah is working hard to bolster its Jewish offerings.
              <p> Last year its leaders traveled to Havana to train for the High 
                Holy Days. And, with the help of other Americans, they started 
                a Sunday school.
              <p> Most of the Cuban Jews with Jewish knowledge are old -- many 
                of them are immigrants from Poland and Turkey. The rest of the 
                community "is looking for a way to emotionally survive," Safran 
                said.
              <p> "My goal was to make a connection between the two communities 
                and show them how a community is participatory," she added. "I 
                think we did that."
              <p> But Safran and others are now concerned about maintaining their 
                relationship with Cuba's Jews. Since two unarmed civilian aircraft 
                were shot down by Cuban military planes in February, the United 
                States has tightened its restrictions on travel to the island 
                nation. Now, U.S. residents wishing to travel to Cuba must go 
                via a third nation.
              <p> As a result, it will be more difficult for American Jews to 
                bring supplies to Cuba's small, struggling Jewish communities.
              <p> These U.S.-Cuban tensions may also make Cuba's Jews feel isolated, 
                and slow down the development of their identities as Jews.
              <p> "Contact with Americans makes them feel like they're really 
                connected," Safran said. "The United States Jewish community means 
                a lot to them."
