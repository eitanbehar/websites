              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I just got back from 
                six weeks in Cuba where I had the wonderful experience of meeting 
                Cuban Jews all over the Island, celebrating Chanukah, Shabbat, 
                and even a bar mitzvah. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I spent the first week 
                in Santiago de Cuba with our friends at Comunidad Hebrea Hatikva 
                where I lived in two different homes of members of the community. 
                Even though more than thirty active members have made Aliyah to 
                Israel, the community is strong and the individuals are as warm 
                and loving as ever.Services continue to be moving in this community 
                even though most of their trained leadership made Aliyah early 
                in 1999. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We celebrated both 
                Shabbat and Chanukah but since there were no potatoes to be had 
                on Friday night, we honored Chanukah by eating fried chicken instead 
                of latkes. Of course, we ate fried chicken in honor of Shabbat, 
                also, since that is the custom each Friday night. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shabbat was a wonderful 
                twenty-six hours as we prayed together, studied together, and 
                ate together. In other words, it was a usual Shabbat in Santiago. 
                On the fourth night of Chanukah we had a very special celebration 
                with lots of dreidle gaming, food, and lively singing and dancing 
                that was enhanced by the participation of the Jewish members and 
                friends of a choral group from Seattle. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the end of the week, 
                two other people and I set out for most of the Jewish communities 
                on the Island. The landscape was inspiring, the Cuban people were 
                very nice, and the members of the Jewish communities were wonderful 
                to us. We discovered that they are very much involved with our 
                heritage and spent long hours talking and planning the future 
                as well as enjoying the present with each other. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shabbat found us back 
                in Havana where we prayed and ate dinner in the social hall of 
                the Patronato. All activities now take place here while the Patronato 
                is being refurbished and is building classrooms in the old balcony. 
                Soon teachers will no longer have to compete with the sounds of 
                other classes sharing the same space nor will any class have to 
                sit on the floor of the sanctuary entranceway in order to have 
                a space of its own. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With Sunday came the 
                twenty-one members of our tour group who were to have a wonderful 
                time visiting three Jewish communities in Havana and three in 
                the countryside. We ate a very tasty and elaborate lunch in the 
                home of the president of Cienfuegos where we were entertained 
                with a performance by the children. Then they danced for us and 
                invited the two children of our group to join in. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Santa Clara was our 
                next stop where we were shocked at the poor condition of the Jewish 
                cemetery that is being used as a sports field by local children 
                who have no other open space in which to play ball. The walls 
                are gone, having become building material for the local homes 
                of these poor people who do not understand that they are being 
                disrespectful to our dead. All but two members of the community 
                met us for dinner at the hotel. It happened to be the night of 
                the brightest full moon in more than a century so we gathered 
                outside before dinner and made a Shehechianu upon seeing such 
                a bright moon for the first time. Suddenly, there was a circle 
                of people, arms entwined, singing Hebrew songs together as one 
                community. It's a wonder we ever reached the dinner table. Our 
                last community outside of Havana was Santiago. One of our greatest 
                joys was taking members of the local communities with us almost 
                everywhere we went and sharing meals with some of them almost 
                every day. Thus, there was a lot of information exchanged and 
                a lot of friendships made. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The most significant 
                highlight of the trip for the ten of us who have been to Cuba 
                before was the bar mitzvah in Santiago of Alejandro Aloma Farin, 
                son of Julio Aloma, religious leader, and nephew of Eugenia Farin, 
                president. Several members of the family participated in the services 
                and we enjoyed sharing this very joyous occasion watching the 
                parents and other relatives bursting with pride. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We spent the afternoon 
                studying, than celebrated in the evening at a party given by our 
                group with dinner, lots of dancing and even swimming . Yes, swimming. 
                We had dinner around the pool at a restaurant that I found just 
                outside of Santiago. Alejandro was raised in the traditional chair 
                before we added to his ritual gifts with a gift to fit the tradition 
                of being a Cuban male – a baseball glove, bat, ball, and even 
                a cap that proclaimed in Hebrew that he is part of Berkeley. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Among the many activities 
                in Havana was the Havana Lodge B’nai B’rith meeting. Warner Bein 
                Oberndoerfer, president of the Golden Pacific Region and a member 
                of our group, spoke about B’nai B’rith projects in the U.S. and 
                Dr. Robert Safran, member of the Oakland Lodge, gave a talk on 
                Prostate Cancer. Now, all Jewish men in Havana will want Vitamin 
                E because Dr. Safran told them it was the only preventive treatment 
                proven to help in the fight against this disease. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I want to leave other 
                tales of the trip for the future and tell you about our new project. 
                The American Jewish Ballet Company is planning to travel to Havana 
                for performances at the historic Lorca Theater on May 27th and 
                28th. They have been invited to participate in the Jewish community’s 
                program to commemorate the visit of the SS St. Louis to Havana 
                Harbor in 1939. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The AJB will present 
                both a Holocaust piece and other pieces based on Jewish life and 
                Biblical stories. Since the performances will be in the Lorca 
                Theater, a popular public hall, non-Jewish Cubans and tourists 
                will also be able to attend. This allows us to raise awareness 
                of the Holocaust among all Cubans and to give tourists another 
                (unexpected) venue for dealing with Holocaust. In addition, such 
                a public activity would serve to raise the stature of the Jewish 
                community in the eyes of the Office of Religious Affairs and other 
                government agencies with whom we will be dealing. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A sponsor’s tour is 
                being organized for those who sponsor a dancer in the Send a Dancer 
                to Havana category at $1000 per dancer. Since there are only twelve 
                dancers to sponsor, be sure to act soon. Of course, we will happily 
                receive funds for arms and legs and torsos if you want to help 
                with the project but don’t have an extra $1000 to spare. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, people often 
                wonder if all this work is making a difference, especially since 
                so many Cubans are making Aliyah. Well, I can tell you that most 
                of them are going to Israel with knowledge of their new homeland, 
                some Hebrew, and a deep feeling of being Jewish. Several people 
                talked to me during the last week to tell me that the Jewish materials 
                we bring are essential to their growth as Jews, as are the individuals 
                we bring to teach. Over and over again, I was told that that they 
                look forward to our groups coming because the extent of our involvement 
                is unique. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I’ll finish by telling 
                you about a comment from my friend, Isaac Gelen, that explains 
                why I expend so much energy for these people. As we returned from 
                our exciting day-long trip to Vinales with ten or more Cubans 
                along, Isaac leaned over from across the bus aisle and said, "June, 
                you don’t bring people to Cuba, you bring love." </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let’s work together 
                to fund the American Jewish Ballet in May,2000. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Send love. </font></p>
