                <p align="left">
                 <p><font face="arial" size="-1">I do not remember exactly the 
                  day on which I met him, but I know that since then, in spite 
                  of the differences in age and character, Luis Chanivecky always 
                  treated me as a friend -- with extraordinary intelligence and 
                  cordiality. Luis was one of those people whom the young people 
                  of today could approach with confidence. He was a perpetual 
                  youth. It was not difficult to establish a dialogue with him 
                  about his family, one's own family, his life as a traveler, 
                  a composer, a Jew and a Cuban. </font></p>
                <p><font face="arial" size="-1"> He was always the hospitable 
                  person, par excellence -- a conversationalist who was happy 
                  and welcoming. The synagogue, for him, was like his home. He 
                  used to enjoy sharing his reflections and his space with the 
                  rest of his acquaintances. I never saw hiim greet anyone half-heartedly 
                  or unwillingly. He was in charge of the religious services in 
                  the Patronato and even though his grave problems of vision and 
                  aging limited him, he did not skimp in involving even more Jews 
                  in the reading of the Torah, religious services, and the Jewish 
                  life of our community in general. If there is a single characteristic 
                  that was not his, it was arrogance. He was always very humble, 
                  with an open heart, noble, and hospitable. </font></p>

                <p><font face="arial" size="-1"> Since I first met him, I knew 
                  that he was a living fount of the history of our community and 
                  of the experience of living in this century as a Jew in Cuba. 
                  One day, I suggested to him that we go to the cemetery at Guanabacoa, 
                  so that he could tell me about the Jews buried there. Immediately, 
                  he accepted, with the sole condition that I call him beforehand 
                  and find transportation. He always used to walk too much [he 
                  tended to overexhert himself] and when I arrived to find him, 
                  Rosita called to me from the balcony, "Take care of him for 
                  me." </font></p>
                <p><font face="arial" size="-1"> What a day! Arriving at the cemetery, 
                  for a moment I thought that he was not going to make it. Luis 
                  told me that I should ask him questions and he would answer 
                  me. We talked about what the Centro Israelita, Old Havana and 
                  the Patronato were like before the Revolution, even more than 
                  about those buried there in the cemetery. </font></p>
                <p><font face="arial" size="-1"> I remember that we ate lunch 
                  at the paladar La Guarida, the location of the film "Strawberries 
                  and Chocolate," and we spent half the day there. We spoke about 
                  the owner of the photos hanging on the wall. At that point, 
                  the subject of Luis the composer took center stage: Luis, the 
                  composer of "La Luna en tu Mirada," "Locura Azul" and the "Bossa 
                  Cubana." When the film "Los Zafiros" debuted, I remember that 
                  Luis told me that they sang several of his compositions in the 
                  film. And so I told my friends, those of my generation (who 
                  only knew what their parents had told them about Los Zafiros) 
                  that a Jewish man had composed various songs for the stellar 
                  quartet. What a surprise to see the credits and observe that 
                  Luis's name was not listed! The following Kabbalat Shabbat I 
                  asked Luis what had happened. Modestly, he told me the story 
                  of what Hugo Cancio, the film's producer, the son of Miguel 
                  Cancio, had done - he had omitted Luis's name on the film credits. 
                  Unfortunately, the error was never corrected, but that did not 
                  decrease the pride of the community and his friends. The film, 
                  cassettes and CDs have received good reviews and are selling 
                  well. </font></p>
                <p><font face="arial" size="-1">Another recollection of that conversation 
                  remains with me. Luis gave me a cassette with most of his music, 
                  including "The Overture of Anna Frank," composed as a theatrical 
                  piece. Although the play was never staged in our community, 
                  Luis told me that in the United States, the music had been played 
                  after a program on the Jews of Cuba. </font></p>
                <p><font face="arial" size="-1"> I would be able to say other 
                  things about that notable man whose major attributes were his 
                  humility and his modesty. He was characterized by a fine sense 
                  of humor and the happiness of one who knows that his life has 
                  been productive. He had an intense love for his family. I remember 
                  sitting at the lunch table at Viñales where we once went with 
                  June Safran. Luis was happy. June had invited him to go with 
                  one of the groups that she brought from the United States, and 
                  he begged to bring his grandson, Rosita and Livat. That foursome 
                  came along and sat side by side. There was a video of the Simcha 
                  group and a show about how as far away as New York one may meet 
                  a gentleman from Yaguajay. </font></p>
                <p><font face="arial" size="-1"> These lines do not pretend to 
                  be a great homage to Luis. He never would have asked for something 
                  like this. These are only some passages that I remember about 
                  him. Those of us who participated in the collective Bar/Bat 
                  Mitzvah ceremony in 1997 were graciously given a set of tefilin 
                  by Dr. Miller, on behalf of the Patronato. It was Luis and Rabbi 
                  Roberto Feldman who taught me to use tefilin. Today, when we 
                  enter his synagogue, his community center, we ought not to forget 
                  Luis. </font></p>
                <p><font face="arial" size="-1"> We thank Luis, Marcus Matterin, 
                  Moises Baldas, and others no longer with us and those here, 
                  that our society did not follow the destiny of the United Hebrew 
                  Congregation. We have the Patronato because it had founders 
                  who raised money to establish it and give it life. But also 
                  it exists because of the people, such as Luis, who, even in 
                  those difficult times of anti-religious discrimination, had 
                  a minyan -- Cuban or halachic -- in order that it never close. 
                  There was a renaissance of Jewish life in Cuba because there 
                  had been continuous supporters, even in the worst of times. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="arial" size="-1"> Luis was above all a good man. 
                  I do not know if he spoke ill about anyone; at least he never 
                  did it to me. He was good because that was the one and only 
                  way he knew to be. He was a man of the community, of his neighborhood, 
                  of his family. Luis was a common man, one of those down-to-earth 
                  men like Abraham Lincoln about whom it was said, "God loves 
                  them so much that he made many of them." <br>
