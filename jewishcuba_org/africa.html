              Religion In Africa and Cuba: How Different Are They Really?</b></font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Much 
              has been made of the differences between the religion as it is practiced 
              in West Africa, and how it is practiced in Cuba. While there are 
              certainly differences between the practices in the two countries, 
              how different are they? And how did they arrive there? It is a story 
              of a failed attempt to systematically destroy the religion and our 
              way of life on two continents, Africa and the New World.</font></p>
            <h3 align="left"><font color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Cuba</font></h3>
            <p align="left"><font color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In 
              Cuba, the religion was brought to its shores with the slaves. Upon 
              arrival, the slaves were forced to practice Christianity in the 
              form of Catholicism. And they were forced to learn Spanish as their 
              main language. They were, of course, forbidden to practice their 
              traditional religion so they took up the practice of hiding the 
              orishas behind the saints. Different groups of Yorubas or Lucum&iacute;s 
              were brought together as one group. There the Lucum&iacute;s began 
              to look at themselves less as belonging to one or another Yoruba 
              nation, and more as subsets of the larger Lucum&iacute; whole. In 
              this way the Lucum&iacute; became homogenized into more of a single 
              nation. In order that the religion survive under the harsh circumstances 
              of slavery, they realized that they needed to restructure the religion 
              somewhat to allow the religion to be best preserved. These decisions 
              were made by councils of the best and brightest priests within societies 
              known as cabildos. There it was decided that as families were often 
              broken up upon arrival to avoid slave revolts, the basic grouping 
              in the religion would become the il&eacute;: the godfamily. This 
              would allow each il&eacute; to act as a secret cell, independent 
              from the others. If one cell was broken the others would have a 
              better chance of survival. This practice has been used in modern 
              times by secret organizations such as the French Resistance in World 
              War II.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It 
              was decided that for the Religion of the Orishas to survive as a 
              whole, it was necessary for each person, upon being consecrated 
              as a priest, to receive a majority of the orishas at that time (Elegba 
              or Eleggu&aacute;, Og&uacute;n, Oshosi, Obatal&aacute;, Oy&aacute;, 
              Osh&uacute;n, Yemay&aacute; and Shang&oacute;). This is opposed 
              to the practice in West Africa, where a priest of Obatal&aacute; 
              would receive Obatal&aacute; and Elegba and no other orishas, and 
              so on. In this way, if a cell was broken, there would be much less 
              chance that the worship of a particular orisha would end with the 
              destruction of that cell. Here the orishas became interconnected 
              more than in Africa. Olok&uacute;n became thought of as the root 
              of all the roads of Yemay&aacute; and Osh&uacute;n was to be regarded 
              as the sister of Yemay&aacute;, etc. In this way, the orishas became 
              a family in much the same way as the godfamily exists in Cuba, Puerto 
              Rico and the United States.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It 
              was impractical to have full fledged Igbo Orisha or Orisha Groves 
              as they had in Africa. The Orisha Grove were consecrated groves 
              dedicated to the worship of the different orishas. There the orisha 
              worshippers practiced their secret rites such as the consecration 
              of priests. No one who was not an initiate was allowed to enter. 
              In the New World, any space was able to be consecrated by priests 
              to serve this purpose and once again only initiated priests or priestesses 
              may enter. In modern times Igbodu is often to be found in someone's 
              garage or basement, anywhere that is away from the prying eyes of 
              the profane, where our rites can be practiced.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Other 
              practices changed as well. In Africa, the stories associated with 
              the different signs in divination or Odu were and are recited as 
              poems. This is an effective mnemonic device, a memory aid that is 
              used by doctors in modern times to learn anatomy. In the New World, 
              as a consequence of Spanish becoming the main language spoken and 
              the loss of fluency in the Yoruba tongue, the stories or histories 
              of the orishas are recited as stories called apatak&iacute;s or 
              'things of importance' with the original Yoruba poems being recited 
              as Suyeres, a kind of ritual language used to salute the odu. As 
              the Yoruba tongue had no written form, in Cuba, the Spanish way 
              of writing was adopted and accents were used to approximate the 
              tonal quality of Yoruba speaking, though the religion has remained 
              by and large an oral tradition and not a written one.</font></p>
            <h3 align="left"><font color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Africa</font></h3>
            <p align="left"><font color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Meanwhile, 
              Africa did not fare much better. Here the religion was attacked 
              on three fronts. Yorubaland was largely structured in the form of 
              City-States much as ancient Greece used to be. To regard the Yoruba 
              as a single nation is as naive as saying all Europeans are the same, 
              where there are language and cultural differences between the diverse 
              range of countries. The religion was practiced slightly differently 
              from region to region and in different areas the orishas that were 
              worshipped were different. Even in If&aacute;, which is arguably 
              the most homogenous of the religious practices in Yorubaland, the 
              very order of the divination signs or Odu are different between 
              Ile Ife and Oyo. These City-States were invaded by successive waves 
              of Fulani tribes who spread the religion of Islam by sword throughout 
              much of the area. There were the effects of the slave trade itself 
              where prisoners captured by warring City-States were sold to the 
              Portuguese, Spanish and English who traded in human lives for a 
              living. This decimated many of the religious groups and partially 
              explains why some orishas much worshipped in Cuba and Brazil are 
              virtually non-existent in modern day Nigeria. Then there was the 
              effect of Colonialism itself. The Colonialists regarded the Yoruba 
              peoples as little more than ignorant savages, children who were 
              in great need of being 'civilized' by the superior Western Europeans 
              who found the Slave Trade and the horrendous Middle Passage a morally 
              acceptable practice. The Yorubas in Nigeria were forced to speak 
              the language of their oppressors and were encouraged to give up 
              their own language. Missionaries taught many of them to practice 
              Christianity and to forget their own ways and religion and the populace 
              were drawn towards the relative wealth of the larger cities where 
              'civilization' took a particularly harsh toll on the religion.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">By 
              the mid twentieth century, the Traditional Yoruba Religion was only 
              practiced by an estimated 10% of the population, the rest had become 
              either Christians or Islamic. Many of the Igbo Orisha had fallen 
              into disuse and decay and many sacred posts were left unfilled due 
              to lack of interest on the part of the young who were more interested 
              in finding their fortunes in the cities and the 'modern world'. 
              The practice of reading the merindilogun or cowrey shell divination 
              had almost ceased to be practiced in Nigeria, with people frequenting 
              If&aacute; priests or Babalawos almost exclusively.And the religion 
              itself was having to adapt itself to a rapidly changing world, much 
              as what had happened in Cuba and Brazil. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In 
              recent times there has been a great resurgence of the religion, 
              not only in Cuba and Africa, but in all corners of the world. In 
              the sixties, the Austrian artist Suzanne Wenger married a traditional 
              drummer in Oshogbo and became a priestess of Obatal&aacute;. She 
              then set about renewing the ancient Orisha Groves there, creating 
              and recreating great beauty where decay had set in. The religion 
              as practiced in Cuba as well as Africa sparked the imaginations, 
              the hearts and the souls of many, particularly in the United States. 
              Pilgrimages particularly to Nigeria had a huge effect on the traditional 
              religion. Where some Yorubas once saw only an embarassing past, 
              they became proud. A renewed interest in the religion caused a massive 
              movement to study and to document the religion in its original home. 
              The groves became the beautiful receptacles of awe and mystery they 
              once were and the worship of the orishas became respectable to the 
              point of being included in the course of study in the major Nigerian 
              Universities. The religion has become popular the world over, with 
              the religion being featured in a recent edition of Vogue magazine. 
              A recent conference on Orisha worship brought people from such diverse 
              places as the Netherlands, France and Germany as well as Cuba, Puerto, 
              Rico, the United States, Brazil, Trinidad and Nigeria. Here, due 
              to the diversity of languages spoken, the main language spoken at 
              the conference was Yoruba!</font></p>
            <h3 align="left"><font color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Conclusions</font></h3>
            <p align="left"><font color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Our 
              religion has suffered through exceptional hardship in its original 
              home in Africa as well as its adopted homes in the Diaspora. The 
              truths of this religion have been preserved in different ways on 
              both continents. Things that were preserved in Cuba and Brazil had 
              almost disappeared in Nigeria. Things that were preserved in Africa 
              had been lost or forgotten in the New World. Truth in this religion 
              is not to be found exclusively in any one place any longer. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">There 
              is an apataki or 'Important History' where Obatal&aacute; had a 
              servant (Eshu) who was envious of Obatal&aacute;'s exalted position 
              in the world. This envy grew to the point that Eshu set about a 
              plot to assassinate the Lord of All The Orishas. One day as he accompanied 
              Obatal&aacute; to the side of a cliff on a tall mountain, he saw 
              his chance. With one push he toppled the Great Orisha off the top 
              of the mountain where he crashed among the rocks below. Pieces of 
              Obatal&aacute; were everywhere.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Orunmila 
              arrived on the scene a little while later, having heard of this 
              great 'mishap' that had occurred. Knowing that the preservation 
              of order in the world depended on it, Orunmila went about attempting 
              to put all the pieces of the Great Orisha back together. While he 
              was able to re-assemble most of the parts of Obatal&aacute;, the 
              task was so great that not even the wise and patient Orunmila could 
              find all the pieces that were strewn across the entirety of the 
              world.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In 
              the same way, the truths of our religion are strewn across the world, 
              on two distant continents. Each area, be it Brazil, Cuba, Trinidad, 
              Puerto Rico or even Nigeria, has only pieces of these truths. And 
              it is up to us to try to complete as well as we can, the monumental 
              task begun by Orunmila, so that our beloved religion may once again 
              be whole. With Wisdom, Love for the Orishas and a true sense of 
              Brotherhood (and Sisterhood) we just may succeed in this daunting 
              task.</font></p>
