                past </font></font></h3>
              <p><font color="#808080"> by Paul Margolis</font></p>
              <p> Now that Cuba is the enemy once again, and the U.S. embargo 
                has been tightened, it's easy to forget that there are 1,200 to 
                1,500 Jews living on that unfortunate island. However, a brother 
                and sister from suburban New Jersey haven't forgotten their responsibilities 
                to Jews in need. They have formed an organization called The Cuban 
                Jewish Aid Society to help these isolated, impoverished Jews, 
                and have traveled to Cuba twice to deliver aid. </p>
              <p>Cuba has always had a special meaning for Stanley Kossof and 
                his sister, Sheila Goldberg. Their father, George Kossof, left 
                Poland for Cuba in 1923, en route to the U.S. Immigration restrictions 
                prevented him from entering the U.S. directly, so he went to Cuba 
                first. He expected to stay only six months, but ended up staying 
                for 11 years, settling in Cienfuegos, a city 150 miles southeast 
                of Havana.</p>
              <p>For the rest of his life, George Kossof spoke warmly of his time 
                in Cuba. He never got the chance to return after he immigrated 
                to the U.S., although he often talked about doing so. </p>
              <p>&quot;Daddy loved Cuba,&quot; says Sheila. &quot;He had good 
                years there, made lots of friends, and had good memories.&quot; 
                Sheila and Stanley, both in their 50s, grew up hearing about the 
                old days in Cuba. </p>

              <p>Cuba probably would have remained solely an association with 
                their father; then Stanley saw a photo-essay of mine on the Jews 
                of Cuba. One photograph was of a Jewish man living in Cienfuegos 
                who had come from Poland in the1920s. It was the only time Stanley 
                had heard of the city except from his father, and he contacted 
                me. </p>
              <p>I referred them to a Jewish organization that sponsors trips 
                to Cuba. In early 1995, Stanley and Sheila traveled to Cuba and 
                visited the Jewish communities of Havana, Santiago de Cuba, Camaguey 
                and Cienfuegos. </p>
              <p>The Jews they met are the remnants of a community that numbered 
                over 15,000 before the revolution of 1959. Highly assimilated, 
                many of them professionals, they lived in relative comfort until 
                the collapse of the Soviet Union threw the Cuban economy into 
                chaos. </p>
              <p> Cuba's Jews were largely forgotten by world Jewry, cut off from 
                the U.S., and until 1991 were discouraged from practicing Judaism 
                by the Communist government. Despite these obstacles, the Jews 
                of Cuba have been reviving Jewish life on the island. Synagogues 
                have been returned to their former congregations, Havana's kosher 
                butcher distributes meat when it's available, Hebrew and Jewish 
                culture are being taught again, and non-Jewish spouses are converting.</p>
              <p>While the Jews of Cuba are undergoing a spiritual revival, they 
                are in desperate need of the basic necessities of life. Food and 
                medical supplies are strictly rationed, often unobtainable. Clothing, 
                books, school supplies and personal hygiene items are almost nonexistent. 
              </p>
              <p>A trickle of assistance from overseas Jewish organizations gets 
                to the 1,000 or so Jews of Havana. However, very little of it 
                goes to the outlying Jewish communities of Santiago de Cuba, Camaguey 
                and Cienfuegos, where an estimated 300-500 Jews live. </p>
              <p>Arriving in Cienfuegos, the city where their father had lived, 
                Stanley and Sheila felt as if they had &quot;come home.&quot; 
                They found their father's name in the 1930 membership book of 
                the social club where he had belonged. They also found Jews living 
                in poverty only 150 miles from Florida.</p>
              <p>&quot;It's hard to imagine Jewish people living so close to the 
                U.S.who are in such desperate need,&quot; says Stanley. &quot;I 
                couldn't believe it when I heard that they didn't even have the 
                basic necessities like soap and toothpaste, but it's absolutely 
                true.&quot; </p>
              <p>In the cities of Camaguey and Santiago de Cuba, they heard the 
                same things: conditions were very bad. Fellow Jews begged them 
                for soap, shampoo, underwear and food for their children. </p>
              <p>&quot;We made a vow that we would never let these people down, 
                never let them be forgotten again,&quot; says Sheila. That was 
                the beginning of The Cuban Jewish Aid Society. </p>
              <p>When Stanley and Sheila returned to the U.S., they called their 
                rabbi and told him their plans. With the aid of their families, 
                members of the congregation and the rabbi, they formed a humanitarian 
                and religious group.</p>
              <p>&quot;Going to Cuba changed our lives,&quot; says Stanley. &quot;Now 
                we have a cause, a mission to help these people.&quot; </p>
              <p>This past January, Sheila and Stanley returned to Cuba with a 
                20-person Cuban Jewish Aid Society group, and a full ton of supplies. 
                They also brought tefillin, siddurim and other religious items 
                for the newly-reopened synagogues.</p>
              <p>&quot;Daddy was always doing acts of tzedakah, of kindness,&quot; 
                explains Sheila. &quot;He would understand why we're helping the 
                Jews in a country where they were so good to him when he came 
                from Poland.&quot; </p>
              <p>The Cuban Jewish Aid Society is a non-profit organization that 
                is registered with the IRS and tax-exempt. They are authorized 
                by the U.S. Government to travel to Cuba to deliver aid to the 
                Jewish communities.</p>
