          </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hundreds of Christian 
          Hispanics in South Florida are discovering they are descendants of Jews 
          who hid their faith.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> A few years after 
          arriving in New Jersey from Cuba as a child, Olga Lea Pérez forged a 
          friendship with a neighbor, a Jewish girl whose necklace carried a Star 
          of David, who told Olga about the religious traditions of her family. 
          That's when Olga felt her first link with the Jewish faith, though she 
          didn't understand why. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> ''I wanted to 
          be like her. It was my neshama (Jewish soul) calling me,'' she says. 
          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Three decades 
          later in Miami, Pérez, who was baptized a Christian but did not practice 
          her religion, again experienced the feeling of belonging to Judaism. 
          While investigating the origins of her family in Cuba, she learned that 
          she was the descendant of Jews who had concealed their religion. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> She chose to convert. 
          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> ''Now I feel free 
          because I know who I am,'' says Pérez, 38, who converted by Orthodox 
          law. ``To realize that what I always felt was true is an incredible 
          feeling.'' </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Dozens of Cubans 
          in exile, and even on the island where they were born and raised with 
          different beliefs and identities, are discovering what their subconscious 
          mind has suggested to them for years: their Jewish roots. Through identity 
          papers, records and genealogical studies, many have confirmed their 
          Jewish origins and are returning to the religion, usually through conversion. 
          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> This weekend, 
          many of them are celebrating the beginning of the Jewish New Year for 
          the first time, but they note that some of the customs of the holiday 
          -- known as Rosh Hashana -- somehow were present in the stories their 
          grandparents told them. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> This group of 
          Cubans is not alone in its discovery. In South Florida and the rest 
          of the Americas, hundreds of Christian Hispanic families are turning 
          to Judaism in the belief that they are descendants of the marranos, 
          the Jews who converted to Catholicism during the 15th Century Spanish 
          Inquisition to avoid being burned at the stake, said Nathan Katz, head 
          of Florida International University's Department of Religious Studies. 
          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Centuries later, 
          they arrived in the Caribbean and South America and kept their traditions 
          secret until they became totally assimilated. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> In Cuba, where 
          they suffered discrimination, many Jews changed their surnames to conceal 
          their identity and entered into mixed marriages. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> After Fidel Castro's 
          revolution, which advocated social homogeneity , the silence was even 
          greater. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> ''Suddenly, when 
          they investigate the past of their families, they discover that the 
          rituals observed by their ancestors had a Jewish, not Christian, origin,'' 
          explains Rabbi Edwin Farber, chief of the conversion unit of the Rabbinical 
          Assembly of South Florida, a Conservative organization. ``They feel 
          they are recapturing something that was taken away from them: their 
          true identity.'' </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Because the conversions 
          are held in strict privacy, there are no figures to show how many Hispanics 
          convert. It is estimated that every year in the United States, about 
          4,000 to 7,000 people adopt Judaism as their religion through a Rabbinical 
          authority, Rabbi Farber said. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> `A SPECIAL CONNECTION' 
          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Mariano Moshe 
          Otero, a 42-year-old Cuban American and a former evangelical minister, 
          knew he was a Jew but had no proof. His mother told stories about his 
          grandparents' home in Cuba, when they would cover the mirrors when someone 
          died, a practice among some Jews. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> One day, Otero, 
          who is Orthodox, received a document that confirmed what he had always 
          known. It was the birth certificate of his maternal grandmother, Dolores 
          Caraza Levi, stating that she was a Jew. According to Rabbinic law, 
          Judaism is passed down from the maternal side, which made Otero a member 
          of the faith. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> ''I always felt 
          I had a special connection,'' said Otero, who is taking Rabbinic studies 
          and helping a dozen Cuban families in Miami track their religious roots 
          through his organization Los Caminos de Israel -- The Roads to Israel. 
          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Rabbi Farber explained 
          that those who have been separated from their Jewish lineage must convert 
          formally to the religion. The requirements include the study and acceptance 
          of the Judaic doctrine, an expression of desire to join the Hebrew faith, 
          a ritual bath and -- for men -- circumcision, he added. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Although the requirements 
          are the same for all converts, the three main Jewish movements -- Reform, 
          Conservative and Orthodox -- have different processes, such as different 
          levels of studies. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> EMERGING FREEDOMS 
          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> In Cuba, where 
          the Jewish community is estimated to number 1,500, many young people 
          who wish to return to the faith have converted or are in the process, 
          especially if their grandparents and great-grandparents entered into 
          mixed marriages, said Ruth Behar, a University of Michigan anthropologist 
          who has studied the subject. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> ''After the revolution, 
          people did not practice Judaism because religion in general was not 
          practiced, especially by young people,'' Behar said. ``So the Jews said: 
          We are Cuban and are not going to segregate from the rest of society.'' 
          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Now that there's 
          more religious freedom on the island and a spiritual awakening has occurred 
          in some circles in South Florida and other parts of the hemisphere, 
          the return to one's roots has become more pressing. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Said Katz: ``Because 
          these are people whose forefathers were forced to convert or did so 
          for fear of anti-Semitism, they are welcomed anew, even after 500 years.'' 
          </font>

          Israel -- The Roads to Israel -- helps Cuban families in Miami trace
