                          it is hard to believe that it has been less than a year 
                          since two fishermen found Elian Gonzales floating in 
                          an inner tube off the Florida coast. Americans have 
                          endured an unbelievable barrage of news stories and 
                          commentary about this episode, and most of us are thankful 
                          that it finally reached a conclusion. </i></font></p>
                      </div>
                      <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="-1">Elian's 
                        return to Cuba may have upset many of the anti-Castro 
                        activists in the Florida Cuban-American community,</font></b><font face="Arial" size="-1"> 
                        but polls show that a solid majority of Americans throughout 
                        the rest of the country supported the reunification of 
                        Elian and his father. In Cuba the sentiment is not all 
                        that different. On several recent visits I witnessed Cubans 
                        react in mock horror whenever the name &quot;Elian&quot; 
                        was mentioned on TV or radio. &quot;No more,&quot; they 
                        begged me. &quot;No more! We can't bear to hear any more 
                        about Elian.&quot; </font>
                      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Despite their 
                        "Elian-fatigue" most Cubans support the Communist regime 
                        on this issue. Although they are having a very tough time 
                        economically, it only seems logical to them that Elian 
                        should be returned to his father. Even Juan Miguel Gonzalez' 
                        determination to return to Cuba does not surprise them. 
                        He is, after all, one of Fidel's faithful. "He's going 
                        to be a star here!" one Cuban told me. Another made the 
                        motions of a beard-their symbol for President Castro-and 
                        told me "He's already offered Juan Miguel a number of 
                        high-ranking positions." Furthermore, Juan Miguel has 
                        family in Cuba and he genuinely likes living in the country. 
                        Whatever his motivations, most Cubans seem to feel that 
                        if he wants to live in Cuba that's his choice, and if 
                        he wants his son to live in Cardenas with him, that is 
                        also his prerogative. Many Cubans continue to bemoan their 
                        country's economic plight, but a substantial number have 
                        increased their support of the Castro regime as a direct 
                        result of this episode. </font>
                      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">The entire 
                        issue has certainly focused more of our attention on Cuba. 
                        In addition to the Elian affair, there have been a number 
                        of trade missions, several prominent defectors, a possible 
                        spy, cultural and artistic exchanges, and even a series 
                        of baseball games. All of this attention has led to curiosity 
                        about the Jewish community on the island, and dramatically 
                        increasing numbers of American Jews are participating 
                        in UJA Federation (now called the United Jewish Communities) 
                        missions to visit the Cuban Jewish community firsthand, 
                        bring food and medicine, and participate in religious 
                        and cultural activities. B'nai B'rith and a number of 
                        other organizations, headquartered not only in Miami but 
                        also in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and elsewhere, 
                        also sponsor such missions. </font></p>
                      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">The missions 
                        have attracted quite a bit of controversy in their own 
                        right. The Forward, always looking for a sensationalist 
                        angle, published a front-page article and an accompanying 
                        editorial in April 2000 attacking the frequency and wisdom 
                        of the missions. Reporter Melissa Radler wrote that there 
                        were no fewer than 30 missions to Cuba planned by local 
                        federations over the next four years. In addition, the 
                        American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee spent $142,800 
                        in 1998 to help the 1500 Jews "it says live in Cuba". 
                        Radler cites the 1999 American Jewish Yearbook estimate 
                        that puts the island's Jewish population at closer to 
                        600. She writes, "Although the missions aren't subsidized 
                        by the Jewish charities, the cost of travel and accommodations 
                        for the 30 groups headed for Havana dwarfs the amount 
                        the Joint is spending there." </font>
                      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">The editorial 
                        was even harsher. The writer, presumably then-president 
                        and editor Seth Lipsky, wrote that all of these missions 
                        are "enough to make one wonder whether the reason for 
                        all this is merely to help the 600 Jews trapped in the 
                        Communist country. Or will the backers of the biggest 
                        American Jewish charitable structure emerge with those 
                        pressing for a soft line on the Communist regime during 
                        the twilight years of its dictator, Fidel Castro?" But 
                        having visited Cuba a number of times in the last several 
                        months, I can state with certainty that not all the Jews 
                        in the country feel "trapped," and I witnessed first-hand 
                        the wonderful work being done by the Joint. The money 
                        being spent is certainly substantial, but it covers a 
                        full-time community coordinator brought in from Argentina, 
                        programming costs, and other more concrete forms of aid.

                      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">In June the 
                        same newspaper printed a lengthy letter from Rabbi Emanuel 
                        Viñas of the Bronx. Rabbi Viñas wrote, "As a Cuban Jew 
                        and rabbi living in America, I feel a personal and professional 
                        duty to express my support for much of what you wrote…Jewish 
                        organizations should not be visiting Cuba as often as 
                        they are. Fidel Castro uses each of these visits to improve 
                        his chances of having the embargo lifted, which would 
                        allow him to continue enslaving the Cuban people at an 
                        even greater profit than at present." Strong words, and 
                        by no means atypical for a Cuban American, Jewish or Christian.</font></p>
                      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">But this is 
                        certainly not the view of many of those left in Cuba. 
                        It is important to realize that the vast majority of the 
                        Cuban Jewish community emigrated in the five or six years 
                        immediately following the 1959 revolution, and by 1965 
                        only about 10% remained. While Fidel Castro originally 
                        had a tremendous amount of support from virtually every 
                        sector of the population, and was careful to avoid any 
                        overt identification with the Communist Party or Communist 
                        ideology, actions that he took in the first several months 
                        of his rule made it clear that his government's policies 
                        were contrary to the interests of the middle and upper 
                        classes, as well as to foreign business concerns. A mass 
                        exodus of the upper and middle classes began by early 
                        1960. The few Jews who remained did so for many reasons, 
                        only one of which was ideological sympathy with Fidel's 
                        form of communism. It is not at all certain that the majority 
                        of those who stayed were ever Communist, and many of those 
                        in the community today either were not born at the time 
                        of the revolution or were small children, and so never 
                        made a conscious choice at all to stay in the country. 
                        Nevertheless, it is clear that after living in Cuba all 
                        of these years the Jews have absorbed many of the attitudes 
                        expressed by the government, which is the only public 
                        position that one can hear on Cuban TV, radio, or newspapers. 
                        But many people still continue to think independently, 
                        despite the efforts made to push the party line. </font>
                      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="-1">It 
                        is interesting to see how the Cuban Jewish community expresses 
                        itself on the Elian issue, as opposed to how many Cuban 
                        Americans view the same incident. During the controversy 
                        the Cuban government held huge rallies in front of the 
                        United States interests section, the unofficial "embassy" 
                        housed in a large building directly on the Malecon and 
                        rented from the Swiss government. In the early weeks first 
                        Dr. José Miller Fredman, the president of the Patronato, 
                        and shortly thereafter Alberto Zilberstein Toruncha, the 
                        president of the Adath Israel Orthodox congregation in 
                        old Havana, spoke at the public rallies. Both emphasized 
                        that Elian should be reunited with his father. Both stressed 
                        the desirability of Elian's return to Cuba. Miller in 
                        particular went beyond the minimalist position--that Elian's 
                        father should be the one to decide where the family should 
                        live--to suggest that Cuba could provide a more wholesome 
                        and less violent atmosphere for his upbringing. This position 
                        went beyond even that taken by the Catholic Church in 
                        Cuba, which argued that Elian should be reunited with 
                        his father, and that his father should then make all further 
                        decisions. </font> 
                      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="-1">That 
                        both Miller and Zilberstein were asked to speak is but 
                        one indication of the close, mutually beneficial working 
                        relationship between the government and the Jewish community. 
                        Despite the strongly anti-Israel position that the Cuban 
                        government adopted in the aftermath of the Six Day War, 
                        and despite the break in Cuban-Israeli diplomatic relations 
                        shortly before the Yom Kippur War, the government has 
                        always gone out of its way to be friendly to the Jewish 
                        community. This sympathetic approach is even more remarkable 
                        in light of the government's policy of discouraging religious 
                        affiliation and activity. Until the 4th Cuban Communist 
                        Party Conference of 1991, religious believers were prohibited 
                        from becoming members of the Party; obviously in a one-party 
                        state such as Cuba the path to the most desirable positions 
                        was through the Communist party only. Nevertheless, the 
                        government allowed the Jewish community to keep five synagogues 
                        functioning in Havana, even after the community had shrunk 
                        to perhaps 10% of its former size. It offered to rent 
                        sections of two of the synagogues, and attempted to assist 
                        the Jewish community in numerous other ways. More recently 
                        el Lider Maximo himself visited the Patronato during Hanukkah 
                        of 1998. After sitting through several dances and songs, 
                        and an introduction by Dr. Miller, Castro spoke at length 
                        with those gathered together. In an informal manner typical 
                        of his speaking style on such occasions, Fidel asked the 
                        group to explain certain facts about Hanukkah to him, 
                        and then carried on an animated dialogue with them. There 
                        was no question that the president charmed the audience. 
                        There seemed little question that Fidel had a warm spot 
                        for Cuba's Jews and they could not help but respond. </font></p>
                      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="-1"> 
                        There has been much speculation exactly why Castro seems 
                        to have adopted such a strongly pro-Jewish policy. Some 
                        suggest that in the aftermath of World War II Castro came 
                        to believe that the moral worth of any government could 
                        be determined by how it treated the Jews. Others have 
                        suggested that Castro adopted and maintained such a sympathetic 
                        policy as one way of showing that despite his alliance 
                        with the Soviet Union he remained an independent force 
                        and could take positions dramatically different from his 
                        Russian sponsors. Others have argued that he may believe 
                        that he is descended from Marranos on his father's side 
                        of the family, or from a Turkish Jewish immigrant on his 
                        mother's side. Whatever the reason, no one has suggested 
                        that the Castro government was ever antisemitic, and virtually 
                        no one has attempted to argue that they ever adopted an 
                        anti-Jewish position. Nevertheless, the anti-Israel position 
                        consistently taken by the Cuban government has upset many 
                        Jews. While this policy has been softened in recent years, 
                        it has not been entirely done away with.</font></p>

                        question of Cuba's policy toward Israel was addressed 
                        by a delegation from the American Jewish Congress, led 
                        by president Jack Rosen, which met with President Castro 
                        during a six-hour dinner held at the presidential palace 
                        in July 1998. Members of the delegation expressed their 
                        disappointment that Cuba was the only country in the Western 
                        Hemisphere to vote against rescinding the United Nations 
                        "Zionism is Racism" resolution. President Castro responded 
                        that he had no knowledge of the vote. Speaker Ricardo 
                        Alarcón, the Cuban representative at the United Nations 
                        who actually cast the vote, was present at the dinner. 
                        Not surprisingly, Alarcón did not offer to field the question. 
                        Other Cuban officials informally told Rosen that the vote 
                        was to be expected considering the fact that the State 
                        of Israel votes against Cuba on virtually every matter.</font></p>

                        that Elian is back in Cuba the issue is no longer active. 
                        Nonetheless the residual impact of the case will continue 
                        to reverberate for months and possibly years. For the 
                        Cuban Americans--particularly those with more hard line 
                        positions--it will be a time of reflection and reevaluation. 
                        They have repeatedly expressed frustration that most of 
                        their fellow Americans did not understand (in their view) 
                        or sympathize (according to a less charitable interpretation) 
                        with their position. Many Americans saw them as shrill, 
                        hysterical, and fanatical-characteristics that helped 
                        neither them nor their cause. Few disagree that President 
                        Castro is a dictator and that the government of Cuba has 
                        unjustly confiscated businesses and generated mass migrations 
                        from Cuba, but it seems a great leap from that to the 
                        position that a group of relatives who had previously 
                        met the child only once should receive priority over Elian's 
                        own father. They picked the wrong cause and they fought 
                        the propaganda war in the wrong way. </font></p>

                        number of news reports suggested that the Cuban government 
                        was claiming victory in the propaganda war with the Cuban 
                        exiles, but it seems more likely that the exiles lost 
                        the battle all by themselves. Many of their spokespersons 
                        made inaccurate, exaggerated or blatantly false statements 
                        on TV, which didn't help their cause either. I heard respectable 
                        representatives argue, for example, that Cuban parents 
                        have no rights over their children in Cuba, but rather 
                        that the children were the property of the state. While 
                        this of course has a basis in the idiosyncratic Cuban 
                        Communist ideology, the way that it was presented was 
                        so distorted as to make it unrecognizable. </font></p>

                        I was resentful that the congress people and other Cuban 
                        American representatives in Florida who spoke so often 
                        and passionately on TV would alter the facts so blatantly. 
                        The inbred Miami Cuban community has taken the trauma 
                        that they experienced and magnified it to the point where 
                        just uttering the word Castro is enough to send them into 
                        fits of uncontrolled weeping, a phenomenon I watched on 
                        television numerous times. They act as if this was a community 
                        that experienced something of the magnitude of the holocaust. 
                        But this is not what happened to them, and without slighting 
                        the degree of trauma that they feel, I think I speak for 
                        a great many who believe that they can and should move 
                        on with their lives and that the American government should 
                        form a rational policy toward Cuba based on legitimate 
                        American political and economic interests, rather than 
                        on the intense hatred of a segment of the Cuban American 
                        community in South Florida.</font></p>

                        was a symbol for both the Castro government and the conservative 
                        segment of the Cuban American community. For the conservative 
                        Cuban Americans the little boy represented freedom, specifically 
                        their struggle to leave Cuba as it became increasingly 
                        Communist and non-democratic. Most had their businesses 
                        confiscated and they felt betrayed by the revolutionary 
                        government, which many of them initially supported. For 
                        Castro, Elian Gonzalez represents an opportunity to proudly 
                        reassert the Cuban commitment to Cuban sovereignty. Castro 
                        has always been able to combine Cuban nationalism with 
                        loyalty to his own form of revolutionary government. The 
                        issue was ideal, because most Cubans could easily support 
                        the cause of returning Elian to his father to Cuba whether 
                        or not they were supporters of the regime, whether or 
                        not they were Communist sympathizers, and whether or not 
                        they felt the country was being managed competently.</font></p>

                        congregants will be able to relate to, and that they can 
                        conceptualize with a Jewish religious context. The Elian

                          that President Clinton and attorney General Reno decided 
                          that upholding the law was more important than playing 
                          to the crowds. It would have been very easy to grant 
                          young Elian asylum here, to grant his extended family 
                          custody of a motherless child and leave it at that. 
                          But this is a country of laws, and this child also has 
                          a father. We may detest the political system of Cuba; 
                          we may even believe that we have a right to work for 
                          its overthrow. But that isn't the same thing as denying 
                          a father and son their god-given right-absent any evidence 
                          of abuse or neglect-to be together. Juan Miguel Gonzalez 
                          has a right to raise his son, and if that means doing 
                          so in Cuba, as much as I might believe they would both 
                          be better off herein the United States, then so be it. 
                          I am proud that once again we can be seen in the eyes 
                          of the world as a nation of laws, not of political expediency.&quot;

                        interesting aspect of the lengthy debate on Elian was 
                        the comparison that was all too frequently made between 
                        Cuban migrants to the U.S. and holocaust refugees. Both 
                        politicians and commentators made this comparison, directly 
                        or indirectly, a comparison that is of course ridiculous. 
                        It is not necessary to add which side was using this polemical 
                        tool. New York Mayor Rudolph Guiliani stated that the 
                        federal troops that took Elian from his relatives' Miami 
                        home were "storm troopers". Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire 
                        called the Wye Plantation in eastern Maryland--where Elian 
                        stayed with his father-a "concentration camp". One of 
                        Smith's aides later said that the Senator had meant to 
                        say "re-education camp" rather than "concentration camp."

                        Slesin, who was a "hidden child" in Lithuania during the 
                        holocaust, has compared the Elian Gonzalez case with Jewish 
                        children hidden from the Nazis during World War II. She 
                        writes that former hidden children describe the psychological 
                        ramifications of their traumatic separation from their 
                        parents, the bonding process that occurred with their 
                        rescuers, and the difficulties that occurred once they 
                        were reunited with their parents. Although she admits 
                        that the historical and political context is radically 
                        different, Slesin argues that the psychological stages 
                        and events that the hidden children went through are parallel 
                        to those that Elian has and will experience. </font></p>

                        writes that having suffered the forced separation from 
                        her parents during World War II, she and other hidden 
                        children that she knows felt that in Elian's case it would 
                        be highly beneficial to him to be reunited with his father 
                        as soon as possible. She wrote that during the holocaust 
                        some Jewish parents were able to give their children to 
                        sympathetic gentiles as their only possible way of saving 
                        those children from virtually certain death. Despite the 
                        urgency of the situation, the children felt abandoned. 
                        Once they were living with their new family most of the 
                        children quickly transferred their loyalty to their adopted 
                        family. In the cases where the children's birth parents 
                        survived and returned for them after the war, it was by 
                        no means always a happy reunion. According to Slesin many 
                        of the children didn't want to go back with their parents, 
                        and felt that they were being abandoned yet again. She 
                        therefore believes, based on her own experiences, that 
                        it would have been far better if Elian had been returned 
                        to his father almost immediately. The extended period 
                        of time that he spent with the "Miami relatives" meant 
                        that like Jewish hidden children he will now have to reestablish 
                        loyalty to his father and he might possibly feel guilt 
                        at "abandoning" his foster family.</font></p>

                        Elian Gonzalez affair is on one level a family custody 
                        case. On another level it is a manifestation of a propaganda 
                        war between Cuban communists and capitalists, the latter 
                        in exile. But on yet another level it is a story filled 
                        with religious themes. Elian has been depicted as a messianic 
                        figure; many Miami Catholics have told and retold the 
                        story that dolphins saved him at sea. The concept of dolphins 
                        as saviors has a Christian basis, but those Christian 
                        sources may have borrowed it from a Midrash on how dolphins 
                        saved some Israelite children who lagged behind during 
                        the parting of the Red Sea. Interestingly, it is not just 
                        the Catholics who interpreted the Elian saga in religious 
                        terms. One of Elian's main lawyers is Spencer Eig, an 
                        Orthodox Baal Teshuva who frequently put the fight to 
                        keep Elian in Florida in the context of the child's right 
                        for religious freedom. Eig compared the Gonzalez case 
                        to that of &quot;a Jew from communist Russia making it 
                        to Israel and then having to be sent back.&quot;(3) Eig 
                        appeared frequently on TV with his large black yarmulke, 
                        an identifying symbol that none could miss. At the same 
                        time, we all understand that Eig's position on Elian is 
                        not the only stance that American Jews are likely to take.

                        may disagree profoundly on what our government policy 
                        should be toward Cuba. As relations between the countries 
                        continue to thaw, many of us may have the opportunity 
                        to visit Cuba and to draw our own conclusions. While few 
                        are likely to come away from the experience demonizing 
                        Fidel Castro, neither are we likely to see the revolution 
                        as a success. Cuba's unique history has created a society 
                        unlike that of any other country in the world. Beset by 
                        economic crisis, the Cubans are hungry, frustrated, and 
                        waiting for change. Nevertheless many retain a certain 
                        fondness for what the revolution has done for them, and 
                        have ambivalent feelings about what the future may bring. 
                        As Jews and as Americans we have an obligation to help 
                        these wonderful people to build a future of hope and of 
                        peace. </font></p>
