                      Last Minyan in Havana</font></a></b> is the story of the 
                      Jews of Cuba, from the years that preceded World War II 
                      until the coming of the Castro revolution. Based on a true 
                      story, the novel follows the life of an immigrant in Poland 
                      to find his fortune in Havana, his wonder at the lushness 
                      of his new tropical home, where he finds a new life, and 
                      the heartbreak of a tragedy that will mark him forever. 
                      The story is played out against the vibrant rhythm of the 
                      40's and 50's when Hollywood Stars made Havana their playground, 
                      and the betrayal of Castro's revolution, which brought to 
                      an abrupt end democratic Cuba and its thriving Jewish community.

                      best efforts, Cuba was destined to play a crucial role in 
                      the wave of refugees that had started to flood America shores. 
                      Geography had placed the small island in the crossroads 
                      of two worlds and history would throw thousands of displaced 
                      souls in its path, forcing it to deal with history in its 
                      own terms.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">On July of 1936 American authorities 
                      proposed that Cuba, due to its strategic location open its 
                      doors to 100,000 German Jews, but the announcement aroused 
                      bitter antisemitic comments in the Cuban press and the proposal 
                      was quickly dropped. A year later the Joint Distribution 
                      Comittee created the Jewish Relief Committee in Havana to 
                      aid the steady stream of refugees that had started to to 
                      come to Cuba. Every day brought hundreds, sometimes as many 
                      as five hundred people to the small, understaffed office 
                      of the JDC looking for money to live on and information 
                      on how to get to the United States or bring relatives into 
                      Cuba. Haim, Gitel and Jacob now looked anxiously into ways 
                      to bring in the rest of the family when Haim got a letter 
                      from Hannah.</font></p>
