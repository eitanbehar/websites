              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">HAVANA (AP) - Like a schoolteacher 
                explaining the intricacies of cursive writing, the Roman Catholic 
                nun patiently demonstrated the sign of the cross to hundreds of 
                men, women and children. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">And then you say, &quot;Amen,'' 
                said the bespectacled sister in a gray habit. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">&quot;Amen!'' the crowd responded 
                happily. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">As this communist nation prepares 
                for Pope John Paul II's visit in January, the Roman Catholic Church 
                is trying to educate a highly secular society about the faith 
                that arrived on the island five centuries ago. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">&quot;There have been many years 
                of secularization, a lot of Marxist education,'' lamented Enrique 
                Lopez Oliva, a historian of religion in Cuba and a practicing 
                Roman Catholic. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Open-air Masses are being celebrated 
                by Cardinal Jaime Ortega, faithful are going door to door, and 
                catechism classes are being held for hundreds of Cubans nurtured 
                on the philosophies of Marx and Lenin. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">&quot;The people have forgotten 
                how to make the sign of the cross,'' said Daisy de Toro, a 55-year-old 
                physician who has carried news of the pope's visit and copies 
                of the Book of St. Mark to all of her neighbors. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">&quot;They have forgotten how 
                to pray,'' she said. &quot;It is our job to teach them how all 
                over again.'' </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Younger people have responded 
                most enthusiastically, De Toro said. At her parish, nearly 500 
                young people show up every Saturday to study the Catholic catechism 
                in preparation for First Communion. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Officially atheist since the 
                early 1960s, Cuba's government began softening its stance on religion 
                in recent years. Catholics and other believers were granted permission 
                in 1991 to join the Communist Party. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">&quot;There has not been a change; 
                there is just more flexibility,'' said Caridad Diego, the party's 
                chief of religious affairs. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Luis Roberto Fondora, a 29-year-old 
                agronomist, wore a large crucifix at a recent Mass. He said he 
                has been Catholic his whole life, but his faith has been invigorated 
                by the prospect of the papal visit scheduled for Jan. 21-25. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">&quot;You can now be Catholic 
                and no one will think you are strange,'' he said. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The push to bring people back 
                to the faith of their forefathers began after communism collapsed 
                in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Cuba lost its former socialist 
                partners and was plunged into dire economic crisis. Struggling 
                for food and other goods the government once provided with Soviet 
                subsidies, many Cubans suddenly felt adrift. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Searching for a new moral compass, 
                many found it in religion: the African faiths of santeria and 
                palo monte, spiritism, and Roman Catholicism. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">&quot;When one does not have 
                faith in something it is difficult to deal with the daily problems 
                of everyday life in Cuba,'' said the Rev. Gabriel Torres Salazar, 
                parish priest at the St. Lazarus shrine outside Havana. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The trend is reflected in the 
                growing number of baptisms and other sacraments performed, said 
                Orlando Marquez, spokesman for the Archdiocese of Havana. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">In the capital, a city of 2 million 
                people, the number of baptisms rose from 16,604 in 1987 to 33,554 
                in 1995. Two Sundays a month, Torres performs an average of 40 
                baptisms. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">More dramatic is the increase 
                in weddings, First Communions and confirmations. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The number of Catholic weddings 
                performed in Havana jumped from 138 in 1989 to 507 in 1995. During 
                that same period, the number of confirmations soared from 259 
                to 887 and First Communions from 643 to 2,485. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Marquez said more recent figures 
                for Havana and the nation as a whole do not exist - reflecting 
                the Cuban church's still marginal role in a largely secular society. 
                </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Last year, President Fidel Castro 
                met the pope at the Vatican, calling the encounter &quot;a miracle.'' 
                In June, Cuba's government allowed the public celebration of a 
                Mass in front of the cathedral for the first time since the early 
                years of the 1959 revolution. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The state also gave the cardinal 
                permission to hold a dozen other Masses - most outdoors - to generate 
                enthusiasm for the papal visit. Hundreds show up for the gatherings, 
                which feature large color posters of John Paul and the revered 
                statue of Cuba's patron saint, the Virgin of Charity of Cobre. 
                </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial">&quot;A lot of people have lost 
                their faith over the years,'' said Maria Ortiz, mother of two, 
                grandmother of 10 and great-grandmother of seven. &quot;But things 
                now are getting better for the church. The faith is coming back.''
