          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1" color="#000066"> Two years after the 
            revolution, Cubans began leaving the island on anything that would 
            float--less terrified of Castro's communism, novelist Achy Obejas 
            intimates in "Days of Awe," than they were of the persistent rumors 
            that an invasion and a terrible war would follow. As Obejas' narrator, 
            Alejandra explains it, Cubans feared that their country would be besieged 
            by "another one of those bloody skirmishes the U.S. periodically undertook 
            in Latin America." With much sadness, but little hesitation, Alejandra's 
            parents shipped out in April of 1961 with their 2-year-old daughter 
            in tow, stopping first in Miami, but finally settling in Chicago, 
            where Lake Michigan provides the family with a bit of watery solace 
            that reminds them of their homeland. As Alejandra grows up, she begins 
            to grasp her parents' passionate attachment to their home country, 
            learning as well about their all-but-dormant Jewish roots. Obejas 
            takes the novel's title from the English translation of the Hebrew 
            "Yamim Nora'im," the time between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, those 
            religious "days of awe." But Obejas wisely holds back this explanation 
            until late in the novel after the reader has ample time to absorb 
            the process of awakening that Alejandra undergoes about her own nationality 
            and faith. While both her parents, Nena and Enrique, were born to 
            Jewish families, neither was raised Jewish. Both of their families 
            had turned from their Jewishness as anti-Semitism swept Cuba during 
            and after World War II. Later, in Castro's Cuba, it was simply better 
            to claim no religious faith at all. </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1" color="#000066"> An interpreter and 
            oral translator, Alejandra makes her first trip back to Cuba in 1987 
            for professional reasons, working for a group of progressive Chicago 
            politicians and activists. But her parents' response to her travel 
            plans leaves her unsettled: "My parents are not fanatical refugees, 
            they do not assume everything about the revolution is hideous. As 
            much as they may be alienated in the U.S., they've made peace with 
            the difficult decision to leave Cuba. Yet, when I said I was going 
            back to the island, they paused as if they needed a moment to adjust 
            their antennas, to rearrange their sense of disbelief into something 
            coherent and civil. Then they kicked into exile-style paranoia. </font>
          <p> <font face="Arial" size="-1" color="#000066">"'Be careful--don't 
            talk to just anyone,' my mother warned me about my upcoming visit. 
            'You will get them into trouble if you talk to them.' ... 'You could 
            get yourself in trouble,' my father said. 'You could wind up in jail."' 
            </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1" color="#000066"> Waiting to go through 
            processing in the Havana airport, Alejandra realizes that she hadn't 
            been entirely honest with herself about her reasons for visiting Cuba. 
            The truth was that this trip marked for her a "return to the Land 
            of Oz" she'd conjured in her dreams. With subtlety and grace, Obejas 
            depicts Alejandra's intensifying awareness of her own identity, as 
            a Cuban, a Jew and a woman. </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1" color="#000066"> <img src="achy_obejas.jpg" width="169" height="178" align="left" vspace="4" hspace="4" alt="Achy Obejas">Visiting 
            family and friends, Alejandra encounters a range of attitudes about 
            Castro's revolution, with some believing the man no more than a scoundrel, 
            and others seeing him as merely a flawed revolutionary. Given her 
            own parents' fear of the government, Alejandra is surprised to find 
            the various ways in which Cubans have made peace with their lives 
            under Castro. It would be easier for her to let go of her homeland 
            and return to America, the land where she was raised, she muses, if 
            she could see the world in blacks and whites. </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1" color="#000066"> Through Moises Menach, 
            Enrique's childhood pal, Alejandra learns about the complexities of 
            life in modern Cuba, and she also learns about her parents' ambivalent 
            ties to their own Jewishness. Obejas has created a true wise man in 
            Moises, a man who possesses vision, compassion and the fortitude to 
            carry on, despite hardship. </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1" color="#000066"> With Moises' son-in-law 
            Orlando (permanently separated from his wife, Angela), Alejandra experiences 
            a profound erotic awakening, feeling herself deeply in love for perhaps 
            the first time in her life. Obejas masterfully links identity with 
            place, language and the erotic life, without ever descending into 
            sentimentality. </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1" color="#000066"> Her descriptions render 
            her characters' emotional lives with a precision that precludes exotic 
            stereotyping. But the novel yields further delights, as Obejas allows 
            Alejandra to meditate on the cultural and philosophical differences 
            reflected in language. </font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="-1" color="#000066"> We learn, for example, 
            that in Spanish, it is simply not possible to speak of love for an 
            object with the same word used to speak of human love. This focus 
            on language accounts for one of the novel's most enchanting riches, 
            revealing a capacity to neatly articulate in Spanish the concepts 
            that English and other languages have no words for. </font>
