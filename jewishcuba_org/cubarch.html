                </font></b>Cuba was home to a viable Jewish community for only 
                a brief period of time in the 20th century. In the late 1950s, 
                before Fidel Castro came to power, some 15,000 Jews lived in Cuba. 
                Most of them had settled in Cuba during the first decades of the 
                century; many had become comfortably middle-class, some quite 
                prosperous. All of that changed after 1959, when Cuba became a 
                Communist country. Over 90% of the Jews fled, mostly going to 
                the U.S. By the early 1990s, the Jewish population of Cuba was 
                estimated at 1,000 to 1,200.<br>
                <br>
                Cuba's Jews are primarily Eastern European Ashkenazi, with Sephardic 
                Jews from Turkey making up the balance of the community. The first 
                Jews in Cuba in this century came to do business after the United 
                States defeated Spain in the Spanish-American War of 1898, and 
                Cuba became a sort of U.S. protectorate. The Eastern European 
                Jews tended to use Cuba as a way station into the U.S. in the 
                1920s, when restrictive laws made immigration into this country 
                more difficult. It was possible to go to Cuba, wait six months 
                to get a Cuban passport, then go directly to the U.S. Some Jews 
                stayed in Cuba, others were stranded there by even more stringent 
                immigration restrictions, or by the outbreak of the Second World 
                War after which few thousand Holocaust survivors settled in Cuba. 
                The Sephardic Jews came mostly from Turkey after 1918, during 
                the political upheaval that followed Turkey's defeat in the First 
                World War. The Jews who remained in Cuba after the Castro-led 
                Revolution tended to be assimilated, intermarried and supporters 
                of the government. A high percentage were professionals who enjoyed 
                status and comfortable lives. In 1991, in the wake of the near-collapse 
                of the Cuban economy, the government allowed more freedom of religious 
                observance. Jews began attending synagogues and learning about 
                Judaism for a variety of reasons. Some did it out of a genuine 
                spiritual hunger, others because of the need to be with one's 
                own group in difficult times, and still others from opportunistic 
                motives.<br>
                <br>
                I traveled to Cuba twice in 1994, and again in 1996, to document 
                the rebirth of Judaism on the island. While my primary interest 
                was photographing and interviewing the Jews to report on their 
                lives, I also visited Jewish sites in all of the major cities 
                of Cuba. Havana, which is home to the majority of Cuba's Jews, 
                has three synagogues in varying states of use, two cemeteries, 
                and a kosher butcher shop. Like nearly all of Cuba's buildings, 
                except for those spruced up for the tourist trade, the Jewish 
                sites suffer from nearly 40 years of a lack of maintenance. Havana 
                also boasts one of the stranger Jewish monuments in existence 
                anywhere: a memorial to Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, the American 
                Jewish couple who were executed for attempting to pass atom bomb 
                secrets to the Soviet Union.<br>
                <br>
                The Patronato Synagogue, in the Vedado section, was built in the 
                mid-1950s by Havana's newly affluent Jews. It is hardly architecturally 
                inspiring: the building resembles a shoe box with a McDonald's-like 
                arch in front. The Patronato is both the cultural and religious 
                center for Havana's Jews. The Jewish Joint Distribution Committee 
                maintains an office in the building, there is a library, and classes 
                and social activities are held here. The Patronato is the synagogue 
                to which groups of Jews visiting from overseas are usually taken 
                for Friday night services. Recently the Patronato affiliated with 
                the Conservative movement in the U.S.<br>
                <br>
                Temple Adath Israel in Old Havana is a more modest structure, 
                also dating from the 1950s. A simple concrete building, almost 
                unnoticeable from the crowded, narrow street, it is Havana's Orthodox 
                shul. During the years when religious observance was discouraged, 
                small groups of mostly elderly people attended services here. 
                In late 1994, the first Orthodox bar mitzvah in 30 years was held 
                there.<br>
                <br>
                Havana's earliest synagogue, Chevit Achim in Old Havana, dates 
                from 1914. It is located in what was once a meeting hall and is 
                hardly ever used. A Reform congregation meets sporadically in 
                what was once a Sephardic cultural center in the newer part of 
                the city.<br>
                <br>
                There are two Jewish cemeteries, an Ashkenazic and a Sephardic 
                located in Guanabacoa, a town outside of Havana. Both are reasonably 
                well maintained these days, with a caretaker who sees to their 
                upkeep.<br>

                </font></b>Small pockets of Jews live outside of Havana, in the 
                cities of Santiago, Camaguey and Cienfuegos. In Santiago, at the 
                far end of the island, the community of about 100 Jews got its 
                synagogue back in 1995, after a 25-year period during which the 
                building had been used as a youth center. The shul was re-dedicated 
                in July of 1995, and regular Friday night services are held there. 
                A small cemetery with graves dating back to the 1920s is located 
                about a half-hour drive from Santiago.<br>
                <br>
                In Camaguey, a dusty city in the center of the island, the synagogue 
                was taken over by the government and turned into apartments and 
                a clinic in the 1960s. The community of 75 or so Jews is still 
                waiting to either receive another building from the municipality 
                or to be able to buy their old synagogue from the municipality. 
                The Camaguey Jewish cemetery has been refurbished, cleaned and 
                maintained over the past several years with funds made available 
                by the government and from overseas Jewish agencies.<br>
                <br>
                Cienfuegos is a port city some 200 miles south of Havana with 
                a tiny Jewish community. When I first visited in 1994, there were 
                35 Jews. However, I have since heard that half the community emigrated 
                to Israel. The few remaining Jews meet in each other's homes for 
                holidays, or go to Havana.<br>
                <br>
                <img src="patron.jpg" alt="Havana, Cuba" hspace=10 border=1 height=309 width=206 align=RIGHT><b><font size=-1>Interior 
                of the Patronato Synagogue, Havana. The Patronato was once Havana's 
                upscale shul, built by newly affluent Cuban Jews in the early 
                1950s. Today the synagogue is affiliated with the Conservative 
                movement in the U.S. and serves as the focal point for most Jewish 
                activities in Havana. Photo: Paul Margolis.<br>
                <br>
                </font></b>Near Cienfuegos, in Santa Clara, there is a Jewish 
                cemetery, but few or no Jews live in the nearby city. The Santa 
                Clara cemetery was at one point being refurbished by a private 
                organization, but recently I heard that funding had stopped, and 
                building materials had been stolen from the site. Like Cuba itself, 
                the Jewish sites there are in a state of limbo. The U.S. economic 
                embargo makes it difficult for American Jews to aid Cubans, and 
                the lack of funds hampers importation of building supplies from 
                other countries. Members of the small Cuban Jewish community have 
                been emigrating to Israel in a trickle, thus reducing the numbers 
                of people who are interested in preserving their sites. The future 
                of the Cuban Jewish community--and that of the Jewish sites on 
                the island--depends on the political and economic situation.<br>
