                <p> <b><font size="3" color="#000077">From Correspondent Larry 
                  Woods</font> </b>
                <p><b> HAVANA (CNN) -- When Fidel Castro came to power in 1959, 
                  some 15,000 Jews lived and pursued their religion in Cuba. </b>
                <p><b> Today, there are only an estimated 1,500 Jews throughout 
                  the island. But the anemic numbers conceal what appears to be 
                  a healthy resuscitation among Jewish Cubans still struggling 
                  for survival and for identity in Castro's Cuba. </b>
                <p><b> For one thing, they are coming back to the synagogue, observing 
                  Shabbat, clinging to ancient traditions. <img src="young_people.jpg" align=LEFT> 
                  And while their numbers may be small, youth is present, as young 
                  people lead where elders once did. </b>
                <p><b> Dr. Jose Miller, a leader of the Havana Jewish community 
                  and a retired physician, credits a spirit of tolerance in Cuba 
                  for the resurgence of his religion. </b>
                <p> <b>"Cuba is not a country with anti-Semitic, or anti-anything, 
                  feelings. It's a country of blacks, Jews, Chinese, (people) 
                  from everywhere," he says. </b>
                <p><b> In a country where interfaith marriage is common, many 
                  non-Jewish spouses are also converting. </b>
                <p> <b>"More than 90 percent (of couples are) intermarried," Miller 
                  said. "We talk about 500 Jewish families, but in each family 
                  there is a non-Jew." </b>
                <p><b> Another vital part of Jewish rebirth is seen in the Patranato, 
                  Havana's largest Jewish community center, where families and 
                  friends meet weekly for a welcome hot meal and fellowship. </b>
                <p><b> Much needed supplies -- everything from vitamins to powdered 
                  milk, from toothpaste to pencils, sent mostly from American 
                  and Canadian support groups -- are divided among Cuba's five 
                  major Jewish congregations. </b>
                <p> <b>"We are looking at our tradition of over 5,000 years of 
                  helping each other," says Eddie Levy of Miami, who helped found 
                  a support group for Cuban Jews, called Jewish Solidarity, four 
                  years ago. </b>
                <p><b> Stanley Cohen, of Pittsburgh's branch of Jewish Solidarity, 
                  recently brought a cover for the Torah of Havana's busiest, 
                  but slowly crumbing, synagogue. He says his group sent more 
                  than $200,000 in merchandise to Cuba last year. <img src="scohen.jpg" align=RIGHT> 
                  </b>
                <p> <b>"I feel like history is being made in that we're seeing 
                  something growing and something being nurtured," Cohen says. 
                  </b>
                <p><b> And there is another important institution in the rejuvenation 
                  of the Jewish community -- a kosher butcher shop. </b>
                <p><b> Meat rations in Cuba may be meager -- one pound per person, 
                  three times a month -- but for Orthodox Jews in Cuba, being 
                  able to keep kosher means being able to keep the faith. </b>
