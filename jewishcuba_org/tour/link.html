<CENTER><H4>In spite of the exuberance of the Cuban people, in spite of their ability to overcome hardships, in spite of my admiration for their resilience,
in spite of the sunshine and the color,
this photo sums up my most lasting impression of my two visits there,
an impression of children living in conditions of deprivation.
