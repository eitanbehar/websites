  <P><b><sub><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And for ornaments 
    in your living room, you had two empty Cola cans, I wouldn't dream of criticizing 
    your taste.</FONT></sub></b></P>
  <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><sub>If you invited 
    me to your house... </sub></b></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><sub>And opened the 
    fridge, and all I saw in it was a half a bottle of jugo, and you offered me 
    some, maybe I would accept, but more likely I would say, no thank you, and 
    later when you asked me &quot;Quieres agua?&quot;, I would accept.</sub></b></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><sub>If you invited 
    me to your house...</sub></b></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><sub>And gave me the 
    central chair, and it was hard and wooden and uncomfortable and newly painted, 
    I would remark on the nice paint job, not the discomfort. </sub></b></FONT></P>

    me to your house...</sub></b></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><sub>And it was July 
    26 and you were celebrating, not the revolution, but the day off, and invited 
    me to a very special meal. And told me it was caldosa, and said my hosts had 
    spent most of the day preparing it; and days before looking for the ingredients, 
    such as yuca, calabaza, papas, maiz, platano, menudos de pollo, carne de chivo 
    y condimentos. </sub></b></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><sub>And it was a special 
    day and a special meal, but it looked to me like brown gruel, and it was full 
    of huesos de pollo, but MY portion had what looked like a half ear of field 
    corn, which I cannot digest, because of digestion problems that developed 
    after one of my trips to Africa.</sub></b></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><sub>I would accept 
    the food, and I would eat it, but I would tell you my stories of Africa, and 
    about my little digestion problems, because then I would have a reason NOT 
    to eat the best tidbit in the stew. </sub></b></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><sub>If you invited 
    me to your house...</sub></b></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><sub>You would warn 
    me that there were pedacitos of chicken bone in this meal, and it was dangerous, 
    and I should be careful. I would thank you, and keep eating. And I would spit 
    out the pedacitos of hueso as graciously as I could, like you were doing, 
    after you showed me how to aprovechar every bit you can get. I would appreciate 
    your company and accept your food.<img src="mnmeal.jpg" width="370" height="285" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5"></sub></b></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><sub>If you invited 
    me to your house...</sub></b></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><sub>And you had your 
    refrigerador in the living room, I would admire it, because it is a very important 
    possession, like a ventilador, as well as a good topic of conversation.</sub></b></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><sub>If you invited 
    me to your house...</sub></b></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><sub>And you showed 
    me your new television that you bought in la tienda, with money that your 
    father who lives in Tampa, and you haven't seen in 30 years, sent to you; 
    and told me you haven't had muchas noticias from him. And you showed me una 
    foto of him and his new wife in Florida, who looks 10 years younger than you. 
    I would admire your new TV, and gratefully take your carta for your padre 
    to Canada, so I could mail your thanks to him. </sub></b></FONT></P>

  <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><sub>And it was in 
    the reparto Centro Habana, and you pointed to the ceiling in your living room 
    and showed me a big hole where the ceiling was crumbling, and that was your 
    upstairs neighbour's floor. And they were worried the whole place was going 
    to cave in. And you were worried about exactly the same thing. And cement 
    costs about $25 USD for a wheelbarrowful, or maybe two. And it was un problema 
    grande. And you and your neighbours tenian miedo that the whole building was 
    going to collapse. I would commiserate with you, and neither of us would be 
    able to ver la solucion.</sub></b></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><sub>If you invited

  <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><sub>And your husband 
    was a bartender at an expensive hotel in Havana, and made $100 USD in tips, 
    and you had family en el extranjero. And you still had a little plastic Christmas 
    tree with lights that blinked on and off, and it was in a place of honour 
    in the living room, because you were SO rich, that you actually had YOUR refrigerador 
    in the kitchen. </sub></b></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><sub>And you are my 
    vecina, and you are SO pretty. And you have a VCR, and I wondered, where else 
    but Cuba still uses Beta? BUT there is NO water in the neighborhood. And US 
    dollars can't fix that. </sub></b></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><sub>And I have un 
    problema, and I would like to find plumbing that works. And so you took me 
    to your suegra's house, because she too, lives in Miramar, but she doesn't 
    have the same water problems. </sub></b></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><sub>I would admire 
    your arbolito, but even more I would say THANK YOU for the use of functioning 
    plumbing, but most of all, for your amistad. </sub></b></FONT></P>

    offered me everything you had, however small or large. And you seemed so pleased 
    with my company, and my friendship, and my attempts at conversation, in a 
    language that I am still learning. </sub></b></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><sub>And my interest
