        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>INTRODUCTION.</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
          is the occasional newsletter of Caribbean Medical Transport, www.cubacaribe.com.<br>
          I promised everyone that I would not overburden any reader, and I think 
          I have kept<br>
          that promise. This is the 8th newsletter send out in two years, so we 
          could say <br>
          that it appears quarterly. There are about 2,500 people on the mailing 
          list. You<br>
          got on this list in one of two ways:<br>
          1) You wrote to me about Cuba sometime in the last 10 years. <br>
          2) Somebody put you on our mailing list by going to our web page and 
          nominating <br>
          you, thinking you would be interested in the work we do in Cuba. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>1) 
          CMT REORGANIZATION </strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I 
          think it is time to do some substantial reorganization of how we go 
          about<br>
          our work in Cuba.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CMT 
          was created to deliver donated medical supplies to Cuba. We could do 
          nothing<br>
          by ourselves. With the help of many, many friends, we have played some 
          role in the<br>
          delivery of 21 containers over the last six years. I always felt that 
          we should <br>
          have been able to do more, but we have to work with the permission of 
          both governments.<br>
          It should be the easiest thing in the <br>
          world, loading donated supplies onto a boat and ship them to a place 
          where people<br>
          need them, but the governments complicate everything. We always need 
          to find the<br>
          space where the two governments permit us to operate.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Over 
          the years, that space has become smaller and smaller, to the point where 
          <br>
          we are pirouetting on the head of a tiny pin! So, IN ADDITION to the 
          work in Cuba,<br>
          let?s ALSO be effective and efficient in other places.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> CARIBBEAN 
          MEDICAL TRANSPORT WILL GIVE 5 GRANTS OF $1,000 EACH TO EXISTING NON-PROFIT<br>
          ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE SENDING OR WANT TO SEND CONTAINERS OF DONATED 
          MEDICAL SUPPLIES<br>
          TO JAMAICA, THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, COLOMBIA, GUATEMALA OR OTHER PLACES. 
          We have<br>
          partners in mind, but please write if you would like to apply for a 
          $1,000 grant,<br>
          for yourself or if you would like to nominate someone you know. The 
          application <br>
          process is very easy- just tell us what you are doing! Later I?ll report 
          on who<br>
          received the grants! </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We'll 
          STILL send containers to Cuba, but until such time as that gets easier<br>
          (may it be soon) we are also going to work in places where it is already 
          easier.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>2) 
          SO WHAT CAN WE DO NOW IN CUBA?</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The 
          weak link of this organization has always been ME. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So 
          I'd like to reduce that weak link by allowing other people to do the 
          kinds<br>
          of things that they want to do! I've always believed that decentralized 
          organizations<br>
          can achieve much <br>
          more than highly centralized organizations. Alcoholics anonymous is 
          a good example.<br>
          There is no leader of AA. There is no Board of Directors, nobody gets 
          paid, no <br>
          one person or group of people making strategy and marshaling forces 
          and making decisions.<br>
          What there is, is a shared philosophy by which people volunteer to help 
          each other.<br>
          And AA is one of the most effective organizations that the world has 
          ever seen.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So 
          here is our shared philosophy:</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We 
          want to encourage every good person to develop worthwhile projects in 
          Cuba-<br>
          projects that benefit humanity, and projects that benefit individuals.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> That's 
          it! But as you can see, it is much bigger than sending donated supplies.<br>
          The key is to create committees of interest</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <strong>3) 
          COMMITTEES</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The 
          essential element of cooperative, volunteer effort is a commonality 
          of interests.<br>
          In the example of AA, the voluntary interest is in limiting or eliminating 
          the abusive<br>
          behavior that can be associated with the consumption of alcohol. People 
          who share<br>
          that interest get together and help each other achieve their goals.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Those 
          of us who love Cuba already have our own particular interests. All we 
          have<br>
          to do is allow people with a shared particular interest to communicate, 
          electronically<br>
          and otherwise, and we could see an explosion in the amount of work that 
          gets done-<br>
          work that doesn?t have to go through me! </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Here 
          are two examples:</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 1) 
          We met someone who is a former Board Member of the largest animal welfare 
          <br>
          organization. He loves animals everywhere, and when he realized that 
          he could combine<br>
          his love of animals with his interest in Cuba, the lights went on. We 
          were able <br>
          to send him to Cuba, where he met the people of ANIPLANT, the best Cuban 
          NGO dedicated<br>
          to the care and protection of animals. And then he started calling HIS 
          contacts,<br>
          and now we have a project. We are collecting money and supplies, and 
          we are going<br>
          to make a huge difference in the ability of ANIPLANT to protect animals 
          all over<br>
          Cuba. They can hire a veterinarian for $20 a month who will do sterilizations 
          all<br>
          day long, if we can supply the veterinarian with small surgical instruments 
          and <br>
          anesthesia and a small amount of medication. We don't need to send containers.<br>
          We could fit everything they really need on a few pallets, fly it over 
          from Miami,<br>
          or maybe individual animal lovers will carry anesthesia over person 
          by person. <br>
          And we s<br>
          upport it all with money.</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          2) Just this week we met someone who has become an expert on an affliction 
          called<br>
          Xerderma Pigmentosum. There are 57 cases that we know about in Cuba- 
          - a very rare<br>
          disease caused by a lack of pigment in the skin. The people with this 
          syndrome lack<br>
          vitamins and creams and some clothing and some other items. The person 
          who contacted<br>
          us has his own network of friends, so we are going to support his project 
          with money<br>
          and supplies and technical assistance, such as our travel license and 
          our shipping<br>
          license! </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So 
          that is how the committees will work. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <strong>PEOPLE 
          WITH COMMON INTERESTS WILL FORM COMMITTEES, AND TALK TO EACH OTHER AND<br>
          OTHER PEOPLE YOU ALREADY KNOW</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The 
          role of CMT will be to provide a little bit of organization, and support 
          the<br>
          projects that YOU want to do with money and with donated supplies. And 
          since we <br>
          have a travel license, we can authorize people to travel to Cuba to 
          take charge <br>
          of these particular projects (provided <br>
          that we meet the OFAC guidelines)<br>
          <br>
          OK, I am going to ask for your help to create these committees. I want 
          to hear<br>
          from all 2,500 of you!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here 
          are some areas of interest:</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Animal

          Sustainable Agriculture <br>

          etc.<br>
          </font><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          That's the idea. It is simple. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <strong>4) 
          TWO SMALL THINGS YOU CAN DO! </strong>(Don?t send money!)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A) 
          Tell me which committee you are interested in. Of course you can invent 
          your<br>
          own committee! Tell me what you are really, truly interested in!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B) 
          SEND ME A COPY OF YOUR EMAIL LIST, especially people <br>
          who love Cuba, but not only the people who already love Cuba! We are 
          going to create<br>
          more love by involving more people, people that we already know! Or, 
          send a copy<br>
          of this email to the people on your list. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This 
          whole thing is a little like the Meet Up campaign that launched Howard 
          Dean,<br>
          the ex governor of my State of Vermont. If we start with a few dedicated 
          people <br>
          who are willing to talk to a few friends, we end up with thousands of 
          people who<br>
          will accomplish all the work, out of love and dedication and shared 
          interests.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <strong>IT 
          DEPENDS UPON US </strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've 
          been writing to hundreds of you for 10 years. I know you are interested<br>
          in Cuba. Many of you are fanatically interested, insanely interested 
          and dedicated.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, 
          let me please repeat the TWO SMALL THINGS I HOPE YOU CAN DO</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A) 
          SEND ME AN EMAIL ABOUT YOURSELF and your particular interests in Cuba. 
          Just a<br>
          paragraph or two, although if you have a novel, I?ll read that also. 
          I'll answer<br>
          every email. Where are you from? How did you get interested in Cuba? 
          Where do <br>
          you live? What are your particular interests? I?ll use that information 
          to help<br>
          get you on a committee! Then you can talk to each other, and go to work! 
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B) 
          SEND ME A COPY OF YOUR EMAIL LIST! Do it right now! Or send this email 
          out <br>
          to the people on your list. Talk to other people!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Don't 
          send money!<br>
          Don't do anything difficult!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
          you agree to do steps one and two, we will soon be working on scores 
          of new <br>
          projects! We will authorize some of the best people in the world who 
          wish to travel<br>
          to Cuba, and we will set them free to do wonderful work, with the help 
          of other <br>
          people who want to be involved.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We 
          got a deal? Great!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          <strong>ONE LAST NOTE</strong><br>
          <br>
          Soon enough relations with Cuba will be normalized. People will freely 
          travel here<br>
          and there, whenever they want. People will follow their heart, and engage 
          in the<br>
          world of human endeavors. We don't have to wait. We can prepare for 
          that world<br>
          now, by forming committees, and going about our interests.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Looking 
          forward to hearing from you!</font></p>

          TRAVEL OPPORTUNITIES</strong><br>
          <br>
          Our travel license is valid until Feb 2008. We are going to use all 
          our available<br>
          licences this year. Please write and reserve a license if you wish to 
          travel to <br>
          Cuba legally. PS. Since I am doing this work, I know other groups that 
          have licences.<br>
          I often am able to match people who don't meet our particular travel 
          licence<br>
          with the travel license of a different group. I love to do that because 
          travel is<br>
          a positive good, apart from all the good that travelers can do. If you 
          are a US<br>
          resident who wants to travel to Cuba legally, or know someone who wants 
          to do that,<br>
          please write!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As
