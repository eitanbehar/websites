                      <p><font color="#000000">It is interesting to see how the 
                        Cuban Jewish community expresses itself on the Elian issue, 
                        as opposed to how many Cuban Americans view the same incident. 
                        During the controversy the Cuban government held huge 
                        rallies in front of the United States interests section, 
                        the unofficial "embassy" housed in a large building directly 
                        on the Malecon and rented from the Swiss government. In 
                        the early weeks first Dr. José Miller Fredman, the president 
                        of the Patronato, and shortly thereafter Alberto Zilberstein 
                        Toruncha, the president of the Adath Israel Orthodox congregation 
                        in old Havana, spoke at the public rallies. Both emphasized 
                        that Elian should be reunited with his father. Both stressed 
                        the desirability of Elian's return to Cuba. Miller in 
                        particular went beyond the minimalist position--that Elian's 
                        father should be the one to decide where the family should 
                        live--to suggest that Cuba could provide a more wholesome 
                        and less violent atmosphere for his upbringing. This position 
                        went beyond even that taken by the Catholic Church in 
                        Cuba, which argued that Elian should be reunited with 
                        his father, and that his father should then make all further 
                        decisions. </font></p>
                      <p><font color="#000000">That both Miller and Zilberstein 
                        were asked to speak is but one indication of the close, 
                        mutually beneficial working relationship between the government 
                        and the Jewish community. Despite the strongly anti-Israel 
                        position that the Cuban government adopted in the aftermath 
                        of the Six Day War, and despite the break in Cuban-Israeli 
                        diplomatic relations shortly before the Yom Kippur War, 
                        the government has always gone out of its way to be friendly 
                        to the Jewish community. This sympathetic approach is 
                        even more remarkable in light of the government's policy 
                        of discouraging religious affiliation and activity. Until 
                        the 4th Cuban Communist Party Conference of 1991, religious 
                        believers were prohibited from becoming members of the 
                        Party; obviously in a one-party state such as Cuba the 
                        path to the most desirable positions was through the Communist 
                        party only. Nevertheless, the government allowed the Jewish 
                        community to keep five synagogues functioning in Havana, 
                        even after the community had shrunk to perhaps 10% of 
                        its former size. It offered to rent sections of two of 
                        the synagogues, and attempted to assist the Jewish community 
                        in numerous other ways. More recently el Lider Maximo 
                        himself visited the Patronato during Hanukkah of 1998. 
                        After sitting through several dances and songs, and an 
                        introduction by Dr. Miller, Castro spoke at length with 
                        those gathered together. In an informal manner typical 
                        of his speaking style on such occasions, Fidel asked the 
                        group to explain certain facts about Hanukkah to him, 
                        and then carried on an animated dialogue with them. There 
                        was no question that the president charmed the audience. 
                        There seemed little question that Fidel had a warm spot 
                        for Cuba's Jews and they could not help but respond.<br>

                        <br>
                        There has been much speculation exactly why Castro seems 
                        to have adopted such a strongly pro-Jewish policy. Some 
                        suggest that in the aftermath of World War II Castro came 
                        to believe that the moral worth of any government could 
                        be determined by how it treated the Jews. Others have 
                        suggested that Castro adopted and maintained such a sympathetic 
                        policy as one way of showing that despite his alliance 
                        with the Soviet Union he remained an independent force 
                        and could take positions dramatically different from his 
                        Russian sponsors. Others have argued that he may believe 
                        that he is descended from Marranos on his father's side 
                        of the family, or from a Turkish Jewish immigrant on his 
                        mother's side. Whatever the reason, no one has suggested 
                        that the Castro government was ever antisemitic, and virtually 
                        no one has attempted to argue that they ever adopted an 
                        anti-Jewish position. Nevertheless, the anti-Israel position 
                        consistently taken by the Cuban government has upset many 
                        Jews. While this policy has been softened in recent years, 
                        it has not been entirely done away with.</font></p>
                      <p><font color="#000000">The question of Cuba's policy toward 
                        Israel was addressed by a delegation from the American 
                        Jewish Congress, led by president Jack Rosen, which met 
                        with President Castro during a six-hour dinner held at 
                        the presidential palace in July 1998. Members of the delegation 
                        expressed their disappointment that Cuba was the only 
                        country in the Western Hemisphere to vote against rescinding 
                        the United Nations "Zionism is Racism" resolution. President 
                        Castro responded that he had no knowledge of the vote. 
                        Speaker Ricardo Alarcón, the Cuban representative at the 
                        United Nations who actually cast the vote, was present 
                        at the dinner. Not surprisingly, Alarcón did not offer 
                        to field the question. Other Cuban officials informally 
                        told Rosen that the vote was to be expected considering 
                        the fact that the State of Israel votes against Cuba on 
                        virtually every matter.</font></p>
                      <p><font color="#000000">Now that Elian is back in Cuba 
                        the issue is no longer active. Nonetheless the residual 
                        impact of the case will continue to reverberate for months 
                        and possibly years. For the Cuban Americans--particularly 
                        those with more hard line positions--it will be a time 
                        of reflection and reevaluation. They have repeatedly expressed 
                        frustration that most of their fellow Americans did not 
                        understand (in their view) or sympathize (according to 
                        a less charitable interpretation) with their position. 
                        Many Americans saw them as shrill, hysterical, and fanatical-characteristics 
                        that helped neither them nor their cause. Few disagree 
                        that President Castro is a dictator and that the government 
                        of Cuba has unjustly confiscated businesses and generated 
                        mass migrations from Cuba, but it seems a great leap from 
                        that to the position that a group of relatives who had 
                        previously met the child only once should receive priority 
                        over Elian's own father. They picked the wrong cause and 
                        they fought the propaganda war in the wrong way. </font></p>
