              Like many Cuban-Americans, Betty Heisler-Samuels winces at the mention 
              of Fidel Castro. ``Abominable'' is the word she uses to describe 
              Cuba's enigmatic dictator.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
              And like many Cuban-Americans, Heisler-Samuels arrived here in 1960 
              with next to nothing, went to school, worked hard and built a successful 
              business.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
              But the similarities end there. Heisler-Samuels is Jewish, a minority 
              within a minority in the supercharged cauldron of Cuban-American 
              exile life in America. She remembers a homeland not only warm and 
              ``seductive'' _ as she puts it _ but one that extended a welcome 
              to her mother and father who came from Lithuania and Poland before 
              World War II to escape anti-Semitism and Hitler.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
              ``It was a wonderful place to grow up in,'' said Heisler-Samuels, 
              59, who has just authored a semi-fictional memoir ``Last Minyan 
              in Havana.'' </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">``In 
              many ways it was like growing up in a small town in the '50s anywhere,'' 
              she said. ``Everyone knew who you were and we felt very much at 
              home. It was a very protective environment.''</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
              Cubans referred to the community of 15,000 Jews as ``Polacos'' _ 
              people from Poland. It was a benign term and many Jews who escaped 
              the specter of Hitler and Nazism found in Cuba a place to flourish.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              For Heisler-Samuels, that world came crashing down in October 1960, 
              more than a year after Castro seized power. As he lurched inexorably 
              toward Communism and the Soviet bloc, Castro sent green-fatigued 
              troops to El Encanto, the Havana department store where she worked. 
              </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">They 
              seized the store in the name of the government. Fellow employees 
              warned her to start wearing olive drab and join the union or face 
              a blacklist. Within days, Heisler-Samuels, then 19, was on a plane 
              to Miami. Her mother and father, who lost a lingerie factory to 
              Castro's regime, soon followed _ as did thousands of others.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
              Abrupt departure proved to be a wrenching experience for all fleeing 
              Cubans, but arguably less so for Jewish Cubans who had planted roots 
              on Cuban soil relatively recently. ``They were the first to leave 
              Cuba because they already had the experience of (escaping) Europe,'' 
              said Rachel Lapidot, director of international division of the Greater 
              Miami Jewish Federation.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
              ``They understood immediately before the others that they had to 
              leave right away.'' Now, more than 40 years after the revolution, 
              many Cuban-American Jews have reached the top-rung on the ladder 
              of success here in South Florida and in other places around the 
              nation, particularly New York, New Jersey and Texas.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
              George Feldenkreis, who arrived in Miami with a pregnant wife, a 
              one-year-old and $700 in his pocket, is now chairman and CEO of 
              Perry Ellis International Inc., the fashion giant with annual sales 
              in excess of $250 million.<br>
              Rafael Kravec in 1998 stepped down as CEO of French Fragrances Inc., 
              which just acquired the Elizabeth Arden cosmetics line. Heisler-Samuels 
              is the publisher of a magazine, Entre Nosotros (``Between Us''), 
              aimed at Spanish-speaking Jews in the United States and Latin America. 
              </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">But 
              there are other stories of Cuban-American Jews that are decidedly 
              less upbeat. Bernardo Benes, a Jewish Cuban-American who was a successful 
              Miami banker and businessman in the 1970s, traveled to Havana in 
              1978 to meet with Castro in an effort to ease tensions with the 
              United States.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
              He won the freedom of 3,600 political prisoners, earning him celebrity 
              status and a new moniker: ``The Cuban Henry Kissinger.''</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
              But the Cuban-American community's leadership castigated Benes as 
              a traitor for sitting down with Castro. Anti-Castro radio stations 
              in Miami turned disapproval of Benes into a popular cause. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Suddenly 
              his phone calls were not returned, Benes said. The business friends 
              and contacts he depended on dried up.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
              As a result, he resigned his bank position and became an outcast 
              in the Cuban-American community. ``The social pressure was brutal,'' 
              Benes said. ``It still is.''</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
              According to Robert Levine, director of the Center for Latin-American 
              Studies at the University of Miami, many Jewish Cuban Americans 
              came to view Benes as personifying what could happen to them if 
              they deviated from the leadership's anti-Castro hard line. ``The 
              fear is palpable,'' said Levine, who is completing a book on Benes. 
              ``They don't talk about it, but the lesson is if someone calls someone 
              else a Communist, you stay out of it.''<br>
              Levine says the phenomenon amounts to ``McCarthyism.''</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
              Some Cuban-American Jews whose opinions differ from those of the 
              conservative Cuban-American leadership said they had misgivings 
              about airing their views in public. ``I have to be extremely careful,'' 
              said one prominent business executive, who supports lifting the 
              40-year-old trade embargo on Cuba and who asked not to be identified.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
              Heisler-Samuels is willing to publicly disagree with conservative 
              Cuban-American leaders, especially on the issue of trade with Cuba. 
              She has traveled to Cuba three times, visiting old schools, synagogues 
              and other landmarks of her youth.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
              Heisler-Samuels favors lifting the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba 
              not out of any sympathy for Castro, but rather because she believes 
              it hasn't worked. ``Trying something new may make things better,'' 
              she said. ``People can't see CNN in Cuba, only government propaganda. 
              They are living in a bubble. Without the embargo, Cubans could see 
              how the free enterprise system works everywhere else.''</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
              Cuba was little more than a bus stop for many Cuban Jews whose ancestors 
              had arrived from Europe. But Heisler-Samuels says she feels ``more 
              Cuban now than when I lived in Cuba. Only now, looking back with 
              nostalgia, do we realize what Cuba has meant to us.''</font></p>
