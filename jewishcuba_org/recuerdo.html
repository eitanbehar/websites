                <h2>Un Recuerdo de Abraham Berezniak 
                  <p> by Bonnie Burt 
                </h2>
              </center>
              On Friday, April 24th, 1998, my friend Abraham Berezniak died of 
              kidney failure and other complications in Havana, Cuba. He had been 
              the shochet (ritual butcher) and member of the burial society of 
              the Havana Jewish community. He was most recently head of the Adath 
              Israel congregation in Old Havana. 
              <p> I had met Abraham on the first of my three trips to Cuba in 
                January, 1994. I was immediately taken with his wry sense of humor 
                on the one hand and his fierce need to ensure the continuity of 
                his Jewish heritage in Cuba on the other. 
              <p> Abraham, in his early 50's when he died, remembered the time 
                before the 1959 Revolution when he had attended Jewish day schools 
                and there had been a thriving Jewish community in Havana. He had 
                lived through the post- revolutionary years when all religion 
                was suspect and one had to choose being a "believer" or a Party 
                member. It was a time when synagogue attendance was left to a 
                handful of old people who didn't mind losing whatever benefits 
                one might receive from being a Communist Party member. 
              <p> Throughout the 35 post revolutionary years of economic hardship 
                and massive emigration, Abraham never gave up his desire to see 
                the synagogue full of people once again and to see his son become 
                bar mitzvah. Somehow Abraham was able to maintain daily minyan 
                at Adath Israel throughout the years. He was able to cope with 
                the daily challenges of life in Cuba and with trying to keep a 
                community together in a humorous, upbeat yet totally dedicated 
                way. 
              <p> I happened to be in Havana during the week of Yacob's bar mitzvah 
                in December, 1994. Before the bar mitzvah Abraham invited me to 
                his home to see one of the study sessions he had with Yacob.<img src="abraham.jpg" align=RIGHT> 
                They would study together daily or I should say nightly, after 
                all the day's work and homework was completed. 
              <p> There in his apartment, up a steep set of stairs in Old Havana, 
                in a dimly lit room with a turquoise color refrigerator, I saw 
                Abraham and Yacob do what Jews do all over the world, learn Torah. 
                Since Abraham was able to read Hebrew he was able to teach his 
                son and prepare him for his bar mitzvah. Because Cuba has been 
                cut off from the rest of the Jewish world until recently Abraham 
                had to teach Yacob virtually by himself. 
              <p> The bar mitzvah was not just a big event for Abraham it was 
                also a big event for the entire community. It had been 15 years 
                since the last bar mitzvah in Adath Israel and it was on the same 
                bima that Abraham had his own bar mitzvah some 35 years earlier 
                in 1959, the year of theCuban Revolution. 
              <p> It was a joyous event with the bar mitzvah boy doing a wonderful 
                job. The party afterward included a Cuban conjunto playing Cuban 
                favorites under a picture of Rebbe Shneerson. 
              <p> On a later visit to Cuba, Abraham desperately wanted to get 
                a torah repaired so it would be kosher so they could use it at 
                services. He said the bigger Torah in the ark was kosher but it 
                was too heavy for the old men in the minyan to lift. Rabbi Kelman 
                on our trip was both a rabbi and a sofer (ritual scribe) and agreed 
                to bring it back to the States and repair it. Abraham waited for 
                over 3 hours in our hotel for our delayed return from touring 
                so he could make sure it got to Rabbi Kelman. 
              <p> Ironically, in recent months, perhaps because of the Pope's 
                visit and the concomitant world wide publicity the government 
                had spruced up some of the religious institutions and Abraham's 
                cherished Adath Israel had received some much needed attention. 
                When Abraham became too ill to go up the steep stairway to his 
                apartment, his community had moved a bed into the sanctuary at 
                Adath Israel so he could be cared for by his people and, I imagine, 
                so he could enjoy how beautiful his synagogue had become once 
                again. 
              <p> I will miss Abraham's wit, joy, strength, and friendship. Walking 
                into Adath Israel will never be the same again for me. May his 
                name be a blessing and may his work continue. Adios, mi amigo.
