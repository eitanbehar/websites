              <p><b> HAVANA - Every month, Jose Zaak boards a crowded bus for 
                the eight-hour ride from Camaguey to Havana, a tedious trip with 
                many stops along the way. </b>
              <p><b> It's a ticket that a struggling student can barely afford, 
                particularly in a country where money is so tight. </b>
              <p><b> Destination: Patronato, a Conservative synagogue and Jewish 
                community center. Zaak arrives before Friday's Shabbat services, 
                and departs the next evening. </b>
              <p><b> It is his only choice. There are few Jews in his hometown. 
                To study with a community, he must travel here. </b>
              <p><b> ``I got thirsty, spiritually thirsty,'' says the 29- year-old 
                Zaak, who began studying the faith of his mother three years ago. 
                ``There's something mystical about this. When you are a Jew, you 
                are a Jew in your blood.'' </b>
              <p> <b> Zaak is part of a new generation of Jews in Cuba who are 
                discovering a religion they knew little, if anything, about. </b>
              <p><b> Before Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, about 15,000 Jews 
                lived in this island country. Up to 90 percent fled after the 
                dictator took power, fearing f persecution or wanting to start 
                a new life in countries with free-market economies. </b>
              <p><b> Although there is no history of anti-Semitism in Cuba, followers 
                of the faith were under the same restrictions as practitioners 
                of any religion in this communist country. Practicing any religious 
                beliefs was discouraged, and many Jews, like Christians, kept 
                their faith hidden or abandoned it altogether to survive in the 
                political system. </b>
              <p><b> Today, an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 Jews call Cuba home. After 
                years of decline, the Jewish population is slowly beginning to 
                build again. </b>
              <p><b> ``By the late 1980s, it was so languid that we feared Judaism 
                would become extinguished in Cuba,'' says Jose Miller, president 
                of Patronato. ``We knew we had to act or it would be too late 
                to reverse the situation.'' </b>
              <p><b> While Christian groups often seek new recruits, Jews generally 
                don't evangelize. But it was their only hope. </b>
              <p> <b> Their goal: to reach out to younger Jews and families who 
                had abandoned their religious traditions. They had to establish 
                communities that would reinforce Jewish life, such as schools, 
                kosher butchers and youth organizations. </b>
              <p><b> ``We were dealing with a whole generation who had lived without 
                a Jewish way of life,'' Miller recalls. ``No rabbi, no bar mitzvah, 
                no bat mitzvah, not even a Jewish wedding. They had grown into 
                adults ignorant of Judaism.'' </b>
              <p><b> Miller and other leaders needed financial support and professional 
                assistance to accomplish their ambitious goal. They turned to 
                the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee in New York, 
                a nonprofit organization that provides cultural, educational, 
                religious and humanitarian aid to Jewish communities. With the 
                organization's commitment of volunteers and resources, the Cuban 
                Jews began their rebuilding project. </b>
              <p><b> The easiest target was Havana, home to three synagogues. 
                More daunting was the rest of the country, where Jews were scattered 
                in eight localities. Some lived isolated in small, distant towns. 
                </b>
              <p><b> Active and diligent people were asked to establish some center 
                of attraction in their towns for Jews, Miller says. The effort 
                paid off: Some 110 families came forward in the provinces, and 
                another 400 in Havana. </b>
              <p><b> Sunday schools were formed, even if they had only a few students. 
                A rabbinical tribunal, made up of members from the United Synagogues 
                of America, was assembled to supervise and approve conversions 
                throughout the country. Youngsters organized chorus and dancing 
                groups to provide cultural and liturgical activities. </b>
              <p><b> And it's not just observant Jews who are contributing to 
                the rebirth. People not considered Jewish - gentile spouses and 
                children of gentile mothers - are playing a major role in rebuilding 
                the communities, Miller says. </b>
              <p><b> ``It would not have been possible without volunteers,'' Miller 
                says. ``That has been the key to our revival. People who are giving 
                so much to make us whole again.'' </b>
              <p><b> Rabbis are still in short supply. Congregations share spiritual 
                leaders, or borrow them from other countries for the High Holy 
                Day and other special events. </b>
              <p><b> Miller says Adele Dworin is one of the Jews who stayed. She 
                remembers the difficult years, when Patronato synagogue went from 
                a thriving community to just a few dozen supporters. Pews began 
                to disintegrate and broken windows were left unattended. The sound 
                of children's laughter was nearly silenced as the number of families 
                dwindled to a handful. </b>
              <p><b> ``It was all very sad for me,'' Dworin recalls. ``This was 
                not a paradise.'' </b>
              <p><b> But today, she sees their efforts paying off. Shabbat services 
                draw dozens of worshipers. Members of the youth club perform Hebrew 
                dances at community events throughout Havana. More important, 
                they are curious about their religion. </b>
              <p><b> ``They are asking questions about their heritage,'' Dworin 
                says. ``They want to know about their roots. They are our future.'' 
                </b>
              <p><b> Zaak knows he represents the future. </b>
              <p><b> ``Twenty, 30 years ago, it was a blackout,'' he says. ``Now 
                the lights are coming back on again.'' </b>
