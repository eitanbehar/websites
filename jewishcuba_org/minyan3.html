                      <b>Betty Heisler-Samuels</b> describes her Cuban-Jewish 
                      lifestyle in South Florida.</p>
                    <p>"The Cuban Jews are very different from American Jews,'' 
                      says Heisler-Samuels, author of <b><a href="http://www.lastminyan.com" target="_blank">The

                      identity to be featured this weekend at the Miami Book Fair 
                      International. "We will never be the same because we come 
                      from a background of different experiences. The fact that 
                      we were allowed to come into Cuba, that we were welcomed 
                      and we got to enjoy that country, left an imprint that we 
                      will carry with us forever.''</p>
                    <p>Cuban Jews are part of a larger, national community of 
                      Latin American Jews living a second exile -- and forging 
                      a dual cultural identity in the United States as Hispanics 
                      and as Jews.</p>
                    <p>Strict U.S. immigration policies established in the 1920s 
                      forced thousands of Jewish refugees to settle in Latin America 
                      and the Caribbean. The thriving Cuban-American Jewish community 
                      -- with its own synagogues, cultural clubs and social institutions 
                      in Miami Beach -- sprung from the mass exodus of most of 
                      the 15,000 Jews in the island who fled after the Communist 
                      regime confiscated their businesses.</p>
                    <p>In 1960s South Florida, the Cuban Jews were not readily 
                      welcomed by the American Jewish community, says<b> Caroline 
                      Bettinger-López</b>, author of <b><a href="lopez.html">Cuban-Jewish 
                      Journeys: Searching for Identity, Home, and History in Miami</a> 
                      </b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/157233097X/qid=980612611/sr=1-1/ref=sc_b_1/104-7835721-6152729" target="_blank">(amazon.com)</a> 
                      <a href="http://sunsite.utk.edu/utpress/" target="_blank">(University 
                      of Tennessee Press</a>, $40), a vast ethnographic study.</p>
                    <p>Except for notable exceptions like Temple Menorah, which 
                      offered the refugees free membership and services, "the 
                      Jewish community reacted with coldness and indifference 
                      to them,'' Bettinger-López says.</p>
                    <p>"When Cuban Jews first came to Miami, they came as exiles 
                      like all Cuban refugees. It was a political identity -- 
                      exile from communism. They turned that into a religious 
                      identity very quickly, based on their community model in 
                      Cuba, and especially in Havana, where there was a strong 
                      Jewish community,'' Bettinger-López said.</p>
                    <p>The model: While they interacted with Cuban society, they 
                      had a vibrant community of their own in the island. When 
                      Cuban Jews realized their stay in the United States was 
                      not temporary, they began to build a similar community.</p>
                    <p>"They wanted to forge bonds with the Jewish community and 
                      went over to Miami Beach,'' Bettinger-López said.</p>
                    <p>But the local Jewish community snubbed them for several 
                      reasons, she said: "There was a general perception that 
                      Cuban exiles were wealthy and not in need of help,'' despite 
                      the fact that most refugees came penniless and with few 
                      belongings. And there was "the myth'' that the refugees 
                      were being taken care of by the U.S. government through 
                      the Cuban refugee program.</p>
                    <p>But most significantly, Bettinger-López says, "there was 
                      a large anti-Cuban mentality, especially from the Ashkenazi, 
                      the Jews of Eastern European roots.''</p>
                    <p>The Sephardic, of Mediterranean and Spanish roots, had 
                      "more of a cultural connection with Latino culture. It's 
                      an arguable point, but they were expelled from Spain and 
                      maintained a similar culture to the Cuban culture,'' she 
                      says.</p>
                    <p>That initial relationship, or lack of it, often influences 
                      how Cuban-American Jewish relations play out today.</p>
                    <p>Bettinger-López points to the 1996 installation ceremony 
                      of the first Cuban president of the Jewish Federation of 
                      Greater Miami as an example of worlds at odds.</p>
                    <p>It was a night of jubilation and pride. The room was packed 
                      with Cuban Jews who broke into thunderous applause and cheers 
                      as Isaac Zelcer, an Ashkenazi Cuban Jew, became the first 
                      Latino to hold the position. He had been nominated by an 
                      organization dominated by American Jews to a position traditionally 
                      held by a member of the city's established American Jewish 
                      community -- and many saw it as "a true integration of Latino 
                      and American Jews.''</p>
                    <p>But as soon as Zelcer ended his speech, and more applause 
                      died down, the room began to empty even while the rest of 
                      the program was still going on. Some of the Cuban Jews had 
                      rushed off to end their celebration at Versailles Restaurant 
                      on the outskirts of Little Havana, the quintessential Cuban 
                      hangout.</p>
                    <p>"The night was both a powerful symbol of how Cuban Jews 
                      have become part of the larger U.S. Jewish community and 
                      of the still insular nature of their community, which is 
                      often criticized as only caring about their own,'' Bettinger-López 
                      said. "It did look on the face of it to be very rude, but 
                      I did understand what they were doing. It illustrated the 
                      point that Cuban Jews are inward-focused, and in many respects 
                      this is largely based on history. They were forced to become 
                      inwardly focused when they tried to integrate with the Miami 
                      Jewish community and they were slapped in the face.''</p>
                    <p>Bettinger-López, who grew up Jewish in Pinecrest unaware 
                      of the Cuban Jewish community (the López is her Irish-Puerto 
                      Rican husband's surname), embarked on the research project 
                      as part of her anthropology course work at the University 
                      of Michigan, where one of her professors was Ruth Behar, 
                      a respected Cuban-Jewish anthropologist.</p>
                    <p>In a foreword she wrote for Cuban Journeys, Behar says 
                      Bettinger-López brings "fresh eyes, caring eyes, and critical 
                      eyes to realities that are close to home and yet foreign.''</p>
                    <p>Among the many Cuban Jews Bettinger-López interviewed was 
                      Heisler-Samuels, whose fictionalized family story mirrors 
                      the stories of many Cuban Jews.</p>
                    <p>The Last Minyan, a self-published autobiographical novel, 
                      chronicles the life of a Jewish immigrant who leaves Poland 
                      before World War II for a better life in Havana. As in the 
                      story of Heisler-Samuels' father, Haim Tuchman's life unravels 
                      against the backdrop of 1940s and '50s Havana, where Hollywood 
                      stars frolicked and the glamorous store El Encanto lived 
                      up to its name with the latest fashions from Paris and Milan.</p>
                    <p>"Jews who came to Cuba like my parents did in the late 
                      1930s were caught between two major world events -- the 
                      rise of Nazism in Europe, which they were escaping, and 
                      later on, after they had already established themselves 
                      in their new country, the onset of communism,'' Heisler-Samuels 
                      says. "These were people who left Europe in their 20s, found 
                      a haven in Cuba, and after living out their lives, became 
                      immigrants for the second time in their 50s.''</p>
                    <p>For some like Heisler-Samuels, the permanence of exile 
                      in the United States hasn't kept the Jewish-Latino identity 
                      from further evolving.</p>
                    <p>"I have four generations in my family and each one was 
                      born in a different country,'' Heisler-Samuels says. "My 
                      parents were born in Europe. I was born in Cuba. My daughter 
                      and son were born in the United States, and my grandchildren 
                      were born in Colombia. Talk about the wandering Jew.''</p>
