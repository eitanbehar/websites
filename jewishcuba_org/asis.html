              <p align="left"><b><font size="+1">Introduction</font></b> </p>
              <p align="left">Many years ago I reached the conclusion that Judaism 
                is a singular paradigm of social consciousness and collective 
                unconscious (1). Only this definition has permitted me to understand 
                the survival of the Jewish people in human history. </p>
              <p align="left">When Castro's Revolution came to power in 1959, 
                a huge majority of Cubans did hope that this political movement 
                would bring a better future to Cuba. Under promises of democracy, 
                social justice, and individual freedom, most Cubans - including 
                most of those who are now in exile in Miami and elsewhere - gave 
                support to that dream and hope. </p>
              <p align="left">But it was a paradox that Jews, who historically 
                have been involved in all social reforms and revolutions because 
                it is a part of our religion to look forward a world of justice 
                and peace, took a different approach: 94% of those 15,000 Cuban 
                Jews left the country in the first years, to the United States, 
                to Israel, to Venezuela, to Panama, to Costa Rica, to anywhere. 
                The history of the Jewish community of Cuba in these 40 years 
                is the history of that 6% of a successful and proud community: 
                it is the history of those who stayed and their children. </p>
              <p align="left">In 1959, I was six years old, and my parents were 
                until this day faithful believers in that Revolution. But my personal 
                account will help you to understand the life of those Jews who 
                decided to stay in Cuba and to have a Jewish life over there, 
                <i>lamrot hakol</i> (despite everything). </p>
              <p align="left"><b><font size="+1">Why to leave, why to stay</font></b> 
              </p>
              <p align="left">The Jewish community of Cuba was a young one since 
                1898, when some of the 3,500 American-Jewish soldiers taking part 
                in the Spanish-Cuban-American War came to live in Cuba and established 
                the first cemetery and temple. After that, during the first fifty 
                years of this century, thousands of Jews from Turkey, Poland, 
                Russia, Latvia, and elsewhere came to Cuba, mainly with the hope 
                of jumping to the United States. But the result was that many 
                stayed in Cuba and felt very happy to share their fate with the 
                Cubans. In 1959, the Jews in Cuba almost had reached their climax 
                of economic and social development. </p>
              <p align="left">The answer to why 94% of Jews in Cuba left, is in 
                the words of Max Nordau: "We are so old that in our history everything 
                has happened and nothing new can occur." (2) </p>
              <p align="left">This explains why Jews did not believe in the beautiful 
                speech on democracy and social justice brought by Revolution leaders. 
                Jews were professionals and business people and had recently learned 
                the lessons of totalitarian regimes in Europe. There is a Jewish 
                saying: "When things don't get better, don't worry: they may get 
                worse." </p>
              <p align="left">In Cuba, the remaining Jews, 6% of the total, were 
                those more assimilated, and those who had a belief in the Revolution. 
                Also, many were old people who had no strengths to begin a new 
                life abroad. </p>
              <p align="left">From my childhood, I had the memories of Passover 
                celebration at my grandparents, the taste of matzoth, the curiosity 
                for Hebrew language, the non-consumption of pork or lard in my 
                home, and the <i>brith milah</i> or circumcision. </p>
              <p align="left">There was an incident that changed my life. One 
                day I was doing forced labor in the Lenin Park, south Havana, 
                and also there were volunteers working there. One of those volunteers, 
                a very proud Communist, said to other people in commenting on 
                the newspaper Granma's news on Israel: "The worst Hitler did, 
                it was not to eliminate all the Jews". I said nothing. But I was 
                over there serving a minimum of one year of political prison; 
                it was the year 1970 and I was 17 years old. After that, as soon 
                as I was free, I wanted to live a Jewish life with my community. 
              </p>
              <p align="left"><b><font size="+1">The community</font></b> </p>
              <p align="left">The Jews of Cuba could survive, despite their isolation 
                for forty years, their dramatic depletion in number, the absence 
                of rabbis, cantors (<i>chazannim</i>) and professional teachers, 
                the poverty of the community and its institutions, their assimilation, 
                and the restrictions (until 1991) on religious practice in Cuba. 
              </p>
              <p align="left">The only source for a demographic study of Jews 
                in Cuba has been the Passover census: the registry of people buying 
                once a year matzoth and other Passover products. These products 
                have been donated all these years by the community of Canada and 
                since 1985 also by communities of Mexico, Panama, and other countries. 
              </p>
              <p align="left">In 1989, according to my research (3,4), the community 
                was composed of 892 people, or 305 families. Of these people, 
                635 people were Jews born from a Jewish mother (70%) or from a 
                Jewish father (30%). </p>
              <p align="left">Of a total of 194 couples, only in 14 were both 
                partners Jewish, which shows a 93% of exogamy. In respect to education, 
                22% of adult Jews had a university degree. </p>
              <p align="left">Five synagogues in Havana and one in Santiago de 
                Cuba continued to be places of worship for Jews, as well as a 
                school and other institutions. In the 1970s one of the synagogues 
                (Santiago de Cuba's), the school and the Zionist Union of Cuba 
                were closed for the Jews (the former was reopened in 1996), and 
                another synagogue - the United Hebrew Congregation - was empty 
                and abandoned in the 1980s. Jewish life continued, however, and 
                religious services were never interrupted. The eldest members 
                of the community led the religious life for all these years, although 
                always there was the fear of extinction because the high rate 
                of assimilation and the lack of a religious education at home 
                for the younger generations. </p>
              <p align="left">I realized the fact that children of Communists 
                and "non-Jewish Jews", like myself, were showing interest in their 
                roots. Two things then came to my mind: (1) Hanson's law in sociology, 
                "The third generation remembers what the second tries to forget", 
                and (2) the story of Rabbi Yohannan ben Zakkai, who in the year 
                70 CE, when the Jews and the Second Temple were being destroyed 
                by the Romans, understood that only education could preserve Judaism 
                for next generations. He then created his famous school in Yavneh 
                which permitted the survival of Judaism until this date. </p>
              <p align="left">The Cuban version of Yavneh was the opening of "Tikkun 
                Olam" Hebrew Sunday School in Havana, in the early 1980's. <i>Tikkun 
                olam</i> means in Hebrew "healing, amendment, repair, transformation 
                of the world" and it is our wish expressed in prayers and in Yom 
                Kippur: to repair or mend a world of justice and peace. At the 
                beginning I was the principal and only teacher for a group of 
                twelve children and a few adults. With time, the school grew and 
                we had more teachers and tens of students in different levels 
                of learning. The purpose of the school was to teach Jewish identity 
                and values, to seed the love for their religion and history through 
                the learning of Hebrew language, liturgy, songs, dance, history, 
                Israel, and comparative religion. </p>
              <p align="left">I am very proud that some of those students who 
                even did not know the meaning of being a Jew, have continued their 
                studies in rabbinical seminaries in Argentina and the United States, 
                and others have made <i>aliyah</i> (immigrated to Israel) or continued 
                to teach other people in Cuba. The lessons were accompanied by 
                discussion lectures and video films. </p>
              <p align="left">At the same time we kept all our religious life 
                and traditions, as well as social organizations like B'nai B'rith, 
                Bikur Holim, and young men's and women's organizations. Beginning 
                in the 1980s, thanks to personal contacts, we had contacts and 
                cooperation with the Ecumenical Council of Cuba, the Catholic 
                Church and other Protestant churches. </p>
              <p align="left"><b><font size="+1">Politics and religion </font></b></p>
              <p align="left">Cubans never were anti-Semitic people, and Jews 
                received in Cuba the same treatment as other immigrants. A nation 
                that persecutes Jews cannot last long. Also the Revolution was 
                very respectful toward Jews as a community, although its attitude 
                in respect to religion and Zionism and Israel greatly affected 
                the Jewish community. As a religious people, we had exactly the 
                same discrimination and problems to access jobs and universities 
                as Christians and other religious people in Cuba. As Jews, there 
                was always the suspicion over us because of our feelings towards 
                Israel and other Jews in the world. All this generated some kind 
                of discrimination, but there was no anti-Semitism. </p>
              <p align="left">In fact, Castro's Revolution had an ambiguous relation 
                with the Jews:</p>
              <p align="left"> - For one side, it permitted freedom of culture, 
                even the import of food donations for Passover and New Year, and 
                the domestic purchase of other products, as well as the distribution 
                of kosher meat to the Jews instead of any other meat or poultry 
                by the ration card. The Cuban criminal code protects against national, 
                religious or racial hate.</p>
              <p align="left"> -On the other side, Cuba was training for years 
                thousands of Palestinian terrorists, even those of Abu Nidal and 
                George Habasch; it published a lot of anti-Zionist, anti-Israeli 
                propaganda showing Jewish literature and art and even the Holocaust 
                as Zionist propaganda. Cubans could never read books by Anna Frank, 
                Isaac Bashevis Singer, or Eli Wiesel, or Agnon or Malamud, for 
                example. Cuba was the worst enemy of Israel at the United Nations, 
                and took the initiative of embargoes, sanctions and isolation 
                against Israel, even the infamous resolution "Zionism equals Racism," 
                so unfair and noxious for Israel and the Jewish people worldwide. 
                I attended the session of the General Assembly of United Nations 
                in late December 1991, which unanimously canceled the infamous 
                resolution "Zionism equals Racism", and I will always remember 
                the nonsensical arguments by the Cuban delegate justifying his 
                anti-Zionist vote. </p>
              <p align="left">Finally, Jews shared the same fate as Christians 
                in being discriminated against in jobs and universities. In the 
                late sixties some were sent to the UMAP (<i>Unidades Militares 
                de Ayuda a la Producción),</i> forced labor camps for young political 
                dissenters, religious people, gays, and exit applicants. All Jewish 
                activists were closely under surveillance all the time. And also 
                those "non-Jewish Jews" who reached positions in the Army bodies, 
                Communist Party, bureaucratic structures of power and professional 
                relevance had to work twice as hard and to show much more loyalty 
                to reach and keep their status. </p>
              <p align="left"><b><font size="+1">Life in the nineties </font></b></p>
              <p align="left">In 1991, the Communist Party of Cuba changed its 
                policy of opposition to religion and opened its doors to believers 
                of any religions. In practical terms this meant that thousands 
                of Communists began to attend churches and synagogues. And maybe 
                a few religious Communists were accepted as members in the Party. 
                This change of policy, and the disastrous economic situation in 
                Cuba after the disappearance of Soviet Union - main supplier of 
                financial and economic aid to Cuba -, brought many "non-Jewish 
                Jews" to the community. The fall of Berlin Wall was for Cuba the 
                failure of ideology and the beginning of hard times of hunger 
                and despair. </p>
              <p align="left">Cuba has now its worst rates of malnutrition, suicide, 
                poverty, unemployment, diseases, prostitution, and uncertainty 
                of the last fifty years. </p>
              <p align="left">All those who are coming to the Jewish community 
                are welcome, no matter who they were or how much they cursed their 
                Jewish roots. In Hebrew, <i>teshuvah </i> means "return" and it 
                is the word for repentance. And it is never too late for <i>teshuvah</i>, 
                to come back to the right way. </p>
              <p align="left">Since 1992, the American Jewish Joint Distribution 
                Committee began to give a special attention to Cuban Jews: rabbis 
                and specialists are regularly sent to help the community to organize, 
                to improve the education, to perform conversions, circumcisions, 
                and weddings, as well to supply the spiritual and physical needs 
                of the community. </p>
              <p align="left">Other organizations and communities have increased 
                their support by donating school supplies, medicines, religious 
                books and articles, food, clothing, etc. A large amount of money 
                has been donated for the building of a synagogue in Camagüey city 
                and to repair the other synagogues in Havana. In 1996, the synagogue 
                of Santiago de Cuba was returned to the community and reopened. 
                The women's organization was created, as well as a Haddassah chapter 
                - started and run by Cuban Jewish doctors - for distributing the 
                medicines to the sick. </p>
              <p align="left">Since 1992, many Cuban Jews have expressed their 
                desire to live in Israel, and over two hundred people have made 
                aliyah to Israel since then in small groups of families. Others 
                have emigrated in the 1990s to Europe, the United States, and 
                other countries in Latin America. </p>
              <p align="left">Jewish life continues in Cuba, even when the community 
                replaces itself with newcomers, and young people emigrate and 
                older ones pass away. </p>
              <p align="left"><b><font size="+1">The future of Judaism in Cuba</font></b> 
              </p>
              <p align="left">Talmud Jerushalmi (Berakoth 9.1) says: "As long 
                as a man breathes he should not lose hope." </p>
              <p align="left">The worst times for the Cuban Jews are behind. The 
                community could survive times of isolation and religious restrictions, 
                and the loss of 94% of its population. Assimilation had its effect, 
                as well as the anti-Israel policy by Cuba. </p>
              <p align="left">Cuba always will have a Jewish community. When Cubans 
                reach their democratic goals, many Jews from other countries will 
                want to come to Cuba for business opportunities and to live there. 
              </p>
              <p align="left">The present community will lose some members by 
                family reunification with those living now in the United States 
                and Israel, and most Cuban Jews will not return from these countries. 
                But many Jews from Argentina, Mexico, Venezuela, Canada, Europe, 
                and Canadian and American Jews will find it very attractive to 
                invest there or to practice their professions in the country. 
              </p>
              <p align="left">They will be the next community in Cuba and they 
                will find synagogues where Jews of different generations worshiped 
                every day and every shabbat for forty years under the most difficult
