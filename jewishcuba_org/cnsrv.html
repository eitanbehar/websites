              <p><i>October 13, 1995</i> 
              <h1>Cuban synagogue joins Conservatives</h1>
              <p> HAVANA (JTA) -- The Centro Hebreo Sefaradi of La Havana, Cuba, 
                has become the second Cuban congregation to affiliate with the 
                United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism. 
              <p> In a ceremony held this past July, Dr. Jose Miller, president 
                of the Patronato Synagogue of Havana -- which last year became 
                the first Cuban Conservative congregation -- welcomed the new 
                synagogue as a partner in the task of reviving Jewish life and 
                tradition in Cuba.
              <p> Two days later, in Santiago de Cuba, a group of Cuban Jews, 
                joined by a large delegation from the Miami Jewish community, 
                the Archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, and representatives of the 
                Cuban government, gathered to rededicate the Sanctuary of the 
                Hatikvah Congregation.
              <p> Rabbi Shmuel Szteinhandler of Chile, representing The United 
                Synagogue, brought <i>siddurim</i>, <i>tallitot</i>, <i>kippot</i>, 
                a <i>ner tamid</i> and other ritual articles necessary to establish 
                the new congregation.
              <p> The Sefer Torah entered the sanctuary under a <i>chuppah</i> 
                held by prominent members of the Cuban Jewish community. Rabbi 
                Szteinhandler covered his head with his tallit and blew the shofar. 
                Witnesses said it was a sound heard for the first time in 30 years 
                in Santiago. 
              <p> "These joyous events in the Cuban Jewish community demonstrate 
                the vitality of the emerging Conservative Jewish presence in Cuba," 
                said Alan Ades, international president of the USCJ.
