                        Aviva Slesin, who was a "hidden child" in Lithuania during 
                        the holocaust, has compared the Elian Gonzalez case with 
                        Jewish children hidden from the Nazis during World War 
                        II. She writes that former hidden children describe the 
                        psychological ramifications of their traumatic separation 
                        from their parents, the bonding process that occurred 
                        with their rescuers, and the difficulties that occurred 
                        once they were reunited with their parents. Although she 
                        admits that the historical and political context is radically 
                        different, Slesin argues that the psychological stages 
                        and events that the hidden children went through are parallel 
                        to those that Elian has and will experience. </font></p>
                      <p><font color="#000000">Slesin writes that having suffered 
                        the forced separation from her parents during World War 
                        II, she and other hidden children that she knows felt 
                        that in Elian's case it would be highly beneficial to 
                        him to be reunited with his father as soon as possible. 
                        She wrote that during the holocaust some Jewish parents 
                        were able to give their children to sympathetic gentiles 
                        as their only possible way of saving those children from 
                        virtually certain death. Despite the urgency of the situation, 
                        the children felt abandoned. Once they were living with 
                        their new family most of the children quickly transferred 
                        their loyalty to their adopted family. In the cases where 
                        the children's birth parents survived and returned for 
                        them after the war, it was by no means always a happy 
                        reunion. According to Slesin many of the children didn't 
                        want to go back with their parents, and felt that they 
                        were being abandoned yet again. She therefore believes, 
                        based on her own experiences, that it would have been 
                        far better if Elian had been returned to his father almost 
                        immediately. The extended period of time that he spent 
                        with the "Miami relatives" meant that like Jewish hidden 
                        children he will now have to reestablish loyalty to his 
                        father and he might possibly feel guilt at "abandoning" 
                        his foster family.</font></p>
                      <p><font color="#000000">The Elian Gonzalez affair is on 
                        one level a family custody case. On another level it is 
                        a manifestation of a propaganda war between Cuban communists 
                        and capitalists, the latter in exile. But on yet another

                        themes. Elian has been depicted as a messianic figure; 
                        many Miami Catholics have told and retold the story that 
                        dolphins saved him at sea. The concept of dolphins as 
                        saviors has a Christian basis, but those Christian sources 
                        may have borrowed it from a Midrash on how dolphins saved 
                        some Israelite children who lagged behind during the parting 
                        of the Red Sea. Interestingly, it is not just the Catholics 
                        who interpreted the Elian saga in religious terms. One 
                        of Elian's main lawyers is Spencer Eig, an Orthodox Baal 
                        Teshuva who frequently put the fight to keep Elian in 
                        Florida in the context of the child's right for religious 
                        freedom. Eig compared the Gonzalez case to that of &quot;a 
                        Jew from communist Russia making it to Israel and then 
                        having to be sent back.&quot;(3) Eig appeared frequently 
                        on TV with his large black yarmulke, an identifying symbol 
                        that none could miss. At the same time, we all understand 
                        that Eig's position on Elian is not the only stance that 
                        American Jews are likely to take. </font></p>
                      <p><font color="#000000">Now that Elian is home in Cuba, 
                        the American Jewish community may disagree profoundly 
                        on what our government policy should be toward Cuba. As 
                        relations between the countries continue to thaw, many 
                        of us may have the opportunity to visit Cuba and to draw 
                        our own conclusions. While few are likely to come away 
                        from the experience demonizing Fidel Castro, neither are 
                        we likely to see the revolution as a success. Cuba's unique 
                        history has created a society unlike that of any other 
                        country in the world. Beset by economic crisis, the Cubans 
                        are hungry, frustrated, and waiting for change. Nevertheless 
                        many retain a certain fondness for what the revolution 
                        has done for them, and have ambivalent feelings about 
                        what the future may bring. As Jews and as Americans we 
                        have an obligation to help these wonderful people to build 
                        a future of hope and of peace. </font></p>
