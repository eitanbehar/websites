          1) OUR TRAVEL LICENSE </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
          best news is that we just received a new travel license which will <br>
          be valid until February of 2008! It took almost 5 months to get the 
          <br>
          license extended, but it was all worth it, because now we don&#8217;t 
          have to <br>
          worry for another 18 months! </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The 
          other good news is that the licensable categories have been <br>
          expanded and now include <br>
          * People with a background in health care<br>
          * Educators<br>
          * General humanitarians. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So 
          if you would like to travel to Cuba to help us do our work, or <br>
          know of anyone who would like to travel legally to Cuba, please write 
          <br>
          back and I&#8217;ll see if you can be qualified! There is no place in 
          the world <br>
          like Cuba. I guaranty that you can have a wonderful time doing very 
          <br>
          important work! </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2)

        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our 
          Commerce license has been expanded and is also valid until February 
          <br>
          of 2008! </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We 
          are specifically authorized to send the following categories of <br>
          material:<br>

        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It&#8217;s 
          a very broad list, and we are actively seeking donations in all of <br>
          these areas! Please contact us! </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3) 
          ART PROJECT </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From 
          time to time we try to develop other ways of raising money. One <br>
          way that has worked pretty well has been to sponsor Cuba parties that 
          <br>
          feature original Cuban artwork (and some prints also) </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I&#8217;m 
          attaching a few examples of the work of our friend CHARO, born <br>
          in Nuevitas, Camaguey, now living in Miramar, Havana. (I reduced the 
          <br>
          images to save space if you have a slower computer-larger images on 
          <br>
          request! ) </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Her 
          work has been exhibited throughout Cuba, and in Ecuador, Jamaica, <br>
          Luxembourg, Israel, and a few other countries. She often works with 
          <br>
          mixed materials, utilizing dried plants and flowers (often with symbolic 
          <br>
          religious or healing significance), textiles, string, all towards <br>
          creating a dream world of elves, trolls, princesses, witches, damsels 
          in <br>
          distress , and damsels in no distress! Her larger pieces have been compared 
          <br>
          to Chagall, with reason. They are stunning! You can&#8217;t get a good 
          sense <br>
          of them from a scan- they are very tactile and very evocative. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And 
          the best news is - Charo donates these small pieces to us, about <br>
          five inches by 8 inches, and we donate an original painting to the <br>
          folks that give us a donation of $30 or more. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> THESE 
          ARE SIGNED ORIGINAL PIECES OF ART, NOT PRINTS!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Here&#8217;s 
          how you can get involved:</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A) 
          Order a Charo by sending us $30 (more if you can- the money goes to 
          <br>
          paying costs of shipping, so come on, send $50!) (You can donate online 
          <br>
          at www.cubacaribe.com) <br>
          B) Help us place these Charos in a restaurant, coffee house, gallery, 
          <br>
          or anywhere where we can put up a display about our work in Cuba- and 
          I <br>
          will send you 5 Charos on consignment! If your friends at the <br>
          restaurant want more, we&#8217;ll try to keep you in stock of her and 
          other Cuban <br>
          artists<br>
          C) Help us organize a Cuba party! Perhaps we&#8217;ll drink a little, 
          dance a <br>
          little, try not to cry too much, and we&#8217;ll talk about the great 
          times <br>
          in the past and in the future!- but mostly we&#8217;ll exhibit Cuban 
          artists <br>
          in order to raise money to send another container! I will go anywhere 
          <br>
          for the chance to talk about Cuba <br>
          D) if you would like to acquire a larger original Charo, or know a <br>
          collector who might- write for details! <br>
          E) Next newsletter we will feature a different artist! </font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          4) FLORIDA CONNECTIONS<br>
          <br>
          There&#8217;s a good chance that I will move to Florida sometime after 
          the <br>
          snow buries my car up here in Vermont. I&#8217;m thinking that I will 
          be able <br>
          to make lots more connections- medical supplies, other donations, <br>
          donors, good friends- if I live in a place where there are more Cubans. 
          I&#8217;d <br>
          love to meet anyone in Florida, to see what we can do to be a little 
          <br>
          more effective in delivering donated supplies to Cuba. If you have a 
          <br>
          Florida connection, please contact me! We are always looking for donations, 
          <br>
          or storage space, or anyone whop wants to help!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 5) 
          WORK IN OTHER CARIBBEAN COUNTRIES</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I 
          never give up. I NEVER GIVE UP! But last year, I ALMOST gave up! </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It 
          is so difficult for a US based organization to do work in Cuba. <br>
          But since I started collecting these donated supplies, I can&#8217;t 
          think of <br>
          anything else I could do that would be more useful or valuable. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> There 
          was a period when I believed that it MIGHT be IMPOSSIBLE for <br>
          us to continue in Cuba. So last year I went to Colombia, learned how 
          <br>
          things work there, and created a branch of Caribbean Medical Transport 
          <br>
          registered in Colombia. This year I will be going to the Dominican <br>
          Republic, to see what can be done there. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> My 
          heart is always in Cuba. However, there are certain kinds of <br>
          donations, such a computers, that US laws do not permit us to send to 
          Cuba. <br>
          There are other types of donations that Cuba does not need, and there 
          <br>
          are other things that Cuba will not easily accept. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The 
          logical solution is to accept all donations, and send what we <br>
          can to Cuba, and other donations to other places. I hope to get one 
          <br>
          container off to Colombia, and another to the DR shortly after the first 
          of <br>
          the year. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> If 
          you know of a worthy organization working anywhere in the <br>
          Caribbean that deserves support- I would love to partner with them. 
          Future <br>
          newsletters will detail what we were able to do. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6) 
          A PERSONAL NOTE</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> If 
          you read the last newsletter, I mentioned the incidental news <br>
          that I had been detained in a Cuban detention center for a little while, 
          <br>
          no explanation given. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I 
          have recently been told that I am not on any immigration black <br>
          list- that&#8217;s good! </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Better 
          yet, at least 40 folks have gone under our license, without <br>
          repercussions to anyone.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I 
          do have some people in the right places and I have been told that <br>
          the situation has been resolved. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In 
          the meantime, we will do our work- and to protect our colleagues <br>
          and partners throughout the world, I&#8217;m not going to write so much 
          about <br>
          specific projects. We have been involved with 5 containers that went 
          <br>
          out this year, and we have projects in lots of different areas- but 
          until <br>
          such time as the level of suspicion between Cuba and the US is <br>
          substantially diminished- talking at length about the work we do has 
          the <br>
          potential of creating obstacles. I&#8217;m looking forward to the day 
          when normal <br>
          people can act normal, visit their friends whenever they choose, do 
          <br>
          whatever good work that inspires them. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This 
          year, wonderful people have stepped forward to take charge of <br>
          various projects. I don&#8217;t need to list you, or even talk about 
          the <br>
          projects- medical, environmental, cultural, educational, animal welfare- 
          a <br>
          broad range of worthwhile activities. None of you are doing this work 
          <br>
          for the recognition.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> With 
          all my heart I hope to see you soon in Havana or maybe in <br>
          Santiago de Cuba! </font></p>
