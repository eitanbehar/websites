          Cuba - During the High Holy Days this year, an unlikely community is 
          celebrating not just the start of a new year but also the beginning 
          of a new era.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Adela Dworin, head 
          of the Jewish community in Havana, can boast of more than 10,000 volumes 
          on Jewish literature at the Abraham Marcus Matterin communal library 
          in the capital.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At Rosh Hashanah 
          services last week at Havana&#8217;s Beth Shalom synagogue, a record 
          crowd of 200 people was in attendance, with children running in the 
          aisles. Many of the worshippers were converts who came to Judaism as 
          recently as last January. For the first time since the Cuban revolution, 
          the Jewish community is growing and distant Jews are returning.</font></p>

        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the past 
          decade, the Jewish community has flown in a group of rabbis every two 
          years to lead Jewish conversion classes. The latest class ended this 
          January with 73 men each going through a ritual circumcision at a local 
          hospital. Most of them were on hand last week for their first Rosh Hashanah 
          as full-fledged Jews.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This was also the 
          first Rosh Hashanah without Fidel Castro in firm command of the country. 
          Castro&#8217;s health status has been a matter of widespread speculation 
          since the leader failed to surface the day of his recent 81st birthday. 
          But while the uncertainty has had many here on edge, the Jewish community 
          is wearing a confident and hopeful face, which many attribute to Castro&#8217;s 
          unexpected openness toward religion since the fall of the Soviet Union.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;We are on 
          our way back from assimilation,&#8221; said William Miller, a full-time 
          communal worker who runs the local operations for the international 
          Jewish organization World ORT.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today, Cuba&#8217;s 
          Jewish community consists of about 1,500 members, most of them in the 
          capital, Havana, which has three synagogues and a Jewish community center. 
          During last week&#8217;s services at Beth Shalom, in the relatively 
          affluent neighborhood of Vedado, there was a mixed crowd: older community 
          members with younger families; many children, and the inevitable presence 
          of Israeli backpackers.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The service itself 
          was conducted in Spanish, with some translation into Hebrew and English. 
          In a country where product shortages are a constant concern, a last-minute 
          snag almost left the congregation without honey for the traditional 
          blessings with apples. But an hour before the holiday began, a batch 
          of honey was found.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shortages are a 
          steady fact of life for every community in Cuba. To address this problem, 
          each year Canadian Jews send to Cuba a shipment of kosher food packages, 
          a gift that has turned out to be not only a welcome addition to insufficient 
          food rations but also a means to attract Jews back to the community.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Passover handout 
          of the Canadian food, which brings together not only active Jews but 
          also those who have little to do with the community, serves as a chance 
          to reach out and offer otherwise disconnected Jews an opportunity to 
          join the community.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;It&#8217;s 
          a great way to get our message out,&#8221; Miller said.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Things were not 
          always so encouraging. During Castro&#8217;s early years in power, religion 
          was officially shunted to the side in a fashion similar to the Soviet 
          Union, which was the guiding star for Castro&#8217;s regime. Members 
          of religious groups were not allowed to be part of the Communist Party 
          and were denied jobs in government and academia. Many books by Jewish 
          writers were banned at the time. On the other hand, even during the 
          early years of the revolution, Castro made sure that religious groups 
          were protected and were not victims of violence.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most Jews fled 
          to the United States. For the remaining community, the small size and 
          the taboo on religion led to a nearly 90% intermarriage rate, according 
          to some community members. &#8220;The old people kept on coming to synagogue, 
          but they didn&#8217;t bring their children and grandchildren,&#8221; 
          said Miller, whose grandfather was the previous president of the congregation.<br>
          Things began to change in the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet 
          Union.<br>
          <br>
          While Fidel remained a strict atheist, his interest in religious communities 
          grew, peaking in a 1998 visit by Pope John Paul II. Later that year, 
          the Cuban leader convened a meeting with representatives of all religions.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;He shook 
          my hand and kissed me on both cheeks,&#8221; said Adela Dworin, the 
          community president who has spent the past 37 years promoting Jewish 
          life in Havana. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t wash my face for two weeks.&#8221;</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When it was Dworin&#8217;s 
          turn to speak, she invited Castro to visit the Jewish community during 
          Hanukkah. Fidel said he did not know the holiday, so Dworin explained: 
          &#8220;It&#8217;s a holiday commemorating the revolution of the Jews.&#8221;</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Soon after, Castro 
          came to the Jewish community center to celebrate Hanukkah. <br>
          <br>
          These days, the main goal of local Jewish leaders is to attract young 
          Jews who grew up in homes in which Judaism was hardly practiced or there 
          was only one Jewish parent. One of the centerpieces of this effort is 
          the conversion seminars for children of intermarried families. Three 
          rabbis come from Argentina, Chile and Ecuador every second year. For 
          men, the course ends with a circumcision overseen by a mohel and a urologist. 
          Havana has no ritual bath, or mikveh, so converts use the ocean to finish 
          the ceremony.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Among the most 
          recent batch of converts was Daniel Motola, 28. He grew up with a Jewish 
          father but little knowledge of Judaism. Then two years ago his grandfather 
          asked him to carry on the family&#8217;s religious tradition, and Motola 
          jumped in with abandon. He is now the community&#8217;s librarian and 
          also one of its main activists.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During Rosh Hashanah, 
          Motola sat near a table reserved for the so-called &#8220;religious 
          group,&#8221; which studies and attends services on a regular basis. 
          At the table was Jeilo Montagne, 26, who started visiting the synagogue 
          seven years ago.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;I began 
          looking for my roots,&#8221; Montagne said. &#8220;Now I come here because 
          of the community life. We meet here every Saturday.&#8221;</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The biggest missing 
          link is a rabbi. A decade ago, the government allowed for a Jewish representative 
          to go off to New York for rabbinic training at Yeshiva University. &#8220;We&#8217;re 
          still waiting for him to return,&#8221; Dworin said.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the meantime, 
          two representatives from the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee 
          in Argentina assist the community with services and teaching. Community 
          activities include holiday and Sabbath services and a Sunday school 
          attended by 60 children. Havana has its own kosher butcher, though Jews 
          are restricted in the amount of meat they are allowed to buy, as are 
          all Cubans due to rationing regulations.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jewish life in 
          Cuba, however, does come with some advantages, most notably in the complete 
          lack of any security precautions outside Jewish communal buildings. 
          While their neighbors in North America have gotten used to seeing police 
          cars parked outside synagogues during the high holy days, Cuban Jews 
          feel no need to take this precaution.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Look, it 
          is completely free,&#8221; Dworin said.&#8220;We never even think of 
          having any guards,&#8221; she added. &#8220;We are totally safe being 
          Jews in Havana.&#8221;</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bigger point 
          of anxiety these days is the status of the country&#8217;s leader. Ever 
          since Castro underwent surgery in the summer of 2006, his health has 
          been a steady source of speculation. The government&#8217;s propaganda 
          has insisted that Castro is still running the country &#8212; from lengthy 
          articles (titled &#8220;Reflections of the President&#8221;) in the 
          daily newspaper Granma to signs painted on buildings, congratulating 
          the leader for his 80th birthday, which passed more than a year ago.<br>
          </font><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          But meanwhile, the Cuban government has at least temporarily transferred 
          power to Castro&#8217;s brother Raul, whom many in the country view 
          as the future. Observers say that the new regime will not likely mean 
          any big changes for the Jewish community.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;I cannot 
          imagine any circumstances which will be negative for the Jews,&#8221; 
          said Julia Sweig, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. 
          Sweig said that the two leaders have the same views on issues of religious 
          freedom.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dworin said there 
          is some concern that any big changes in the economic situation could 
          cause some young Jews to leave for the United States.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;We have 
          these great young professionals who are active in the community, but 
          many of them still speak about leaving,&#8221; Dworin said. &#8220;If 
          things improve here, maybe Cubans won&#8217;t want to leave.&#8221;</font></p>
