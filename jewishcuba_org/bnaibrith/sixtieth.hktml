                            celebrated its sixtieth anniversary. The celebration
                            is considered one of the most important moments for
                            Cuba's Jewish community in recent memory. </font> </p>

                            celebration was an exciting, two-day event, beginning
                            at 3:30 on Saturday, May 17, 2003 at the Patronato
                            (a.k.a. Jewish Community Center). The facility had
                            a near-full house of 125 people for speeches, award
                            presentations and dinner. The event started with
                            a review of the lodge's history by Lodge President
                            Isaac Rousso. Five awards were presented: one to
                            Stanley Cohen (International Chairman of the B'nai
                            B'rith Cuban Jewish Relief Project) and one each
                            to June Safran and Stanley Falkenstein (from California).
                            Other awards were given to Dr. Jose Miller, president
                            of the Jewish community and Isaac Gelen, past-president
                            of B'nai B'rith Cuba. </font> </p>

                            special highlight was the proclamation honoring the

                            Kaplan (President, B'nai B'rith International) and

                            with a special Humanitarian Award to Isaac Russo.
                            During his speech, Cohen had asked for all of the
                            members of B'nai B'rith to stand. Although not all
                            in attendance were members, everyone stood anyway
                            to applaud B'nai B'rith. <br />

                            Of Havana among other local dignitaries. This is
                            part of the chapter's goal of being a part of the
                            greater Cuban community by having such people speak
                            at their meetings on a regular basis. </font> </p>

                            Sunday, May 18, the lodge held a family-friendly
                            picnic for the Jewish community at large. About 130
                            people traveled in three buses to a park in the mountains
                            about 70 kilometers from Havana. Stu &amp; Karen
                            Cooper brought toys and games for the children such
                            as Frisbees, badminton, jump-rope, and basketballs.
                            These are items the kids would not otherwise have. </font> </p>

                            anniversary celebration was applauded by all the
                            leaders of the Jewish community. Cuban-Jewish leaders
                            came from across the country, including Camaguey,
                            Santiago de Cuba, Santa Clara and Cienfuegos. </font> </p>

                            Maimonides Lodge is probably the fastest growing
                            lodge (percentage-wise) in the world. In early 2002,
                            there were only about 20 largely inactive members.
                            But since Isaac Rousso's election as president, along
                            with our Tzedaka Fund Project and other programs,
                            the membership has more than doubled to about 50
                            very active people. There is now so much interest
                            in joining, that they have temporarily suspended
                            new member admission until recent additions have
                            been absorbed. (It will be reopened to new B'nai
                            B'rith members in June 2003, when membership may
                            double again). The members appreciate the lodge's
                            decision-making power and valuable programs that
                            our support has made possible. </font> </p>
