                      Assistant Editor</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Almost three
                        years ago, Staney Cohen learned of the plight of Cuban
                        Jewry.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">A dwindling
                        yet highly-dedicated and spiritual community, the Jews
                        of Cuba face the harsh reality of life under the Castro
                        regime: food, fuel, basic everyday necessities are rationed
                        or totally unavailable due to a languid economy and a
                        U.S. embargo.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Though the economic
                        situation may be bleak, the religious spirit that characterizes
                        this community is strong. Touched by their enthusiasm
                        and commitment, Cohen made it his mission to publicize
                        Cuban Jewry's plight, to bring them humanitarian relief.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Nearly three
                        years later, Cohen is international chairman of the B'nai
                        B'rith Cuban Jewry Relief Project, and has shepherded
                        efforts to aid their community &quot;that are making
                        a difference.&quot;</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">&quot;We have
                        shipped well over 20,000 pounds of supplies in less than
                        three years - close to $2 million in medicines, food,
                        clothes, and equipment,&quot; Cohen, active in many Jewish
                        communal organizations here, begins.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Often, it's
                        the one-to-one contact that gladdens Cohen's heart. Take
                        the recent UJF mission to Cuba. Briefing the group prior
                        to their trip, Cohen asked one participant to bring a
                        pair of eyeglasses to a little girl.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Her eyes were
                        so weak that conventional glass just wouldn't fit into
                        eyeglass frames - nor could the youngster wear them comfortably,
                        even if they could.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">&quot;This was
                        a real mitzvah,&quot; 
                      Cohen sighs, &quot;helping a six-year-old girl. I'd bring
                      her 100 pairs if she needed them.&quot;</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Cohen enlists
                        anyone and everyone in gathering supplies for Cuban Jewry.
                        Most recently, the local humanitarian organization, Brother's
                        Brother, signed on, donating 250,000 multivitamins. &quot;Cuban
                        Jews have little or no protein in their diet,&quot; Cohen
                        explains of the need for vitamins.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">&quot;We shipped
                        60,000 down last week.&quot; Cohen is a latter-day horse
                        trader, giving Brother's Brother walkers and crutches
                        for Turkey's earthquake victims in return for one-a-day
                        vitamins.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">&quot;I'm a
                        clearinghouse,&quot; 
                      he says simply, of his matchmaking efforts. But, he notes
                      with obvious pride, Pittsburgh is the largest supplier
                      anywhere of relief to Cuba.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">While he sends
                        everything from medicine and Judaica to Cuban Jewry,
                        he's sometimes asked to bring things back. On his last
                        trip, it was something very simple: dirt.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">A non-Jewish
                        reader of the B'nai B'rith Jewish Monthly Magazine read
                        about Cohen's relief efforts on behalf of Cuban Jewry
                        and decided to contact him.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Pedro Ramirez
                        had left Cuba quite suddenly in 1962; his parents sent
                        Pedro and his siblings to the United States to escape
                        an increasingly-hostile Communist regime.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Ramirez, a boy
                        of 14, was left in charge of four brothers and sisters,
                        ranging in age from six on up.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">When the kids
                        got to Miami, there was no one to greet them. U.S. Immigration
                        officials wanted to split up the family, and farm them
                        out to orphanages.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Only Pedro's
                        efforts kept the children together. Three long years
                        later, the Ramirez parents finally made it to the United
                        States, and the family was reunited.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">&quot;He contacted
                        me,&quot; 
                      Cohen says, &quot;and asked if I could bring him back some
                      soil from Cuba. He told me he regularly dreamt about his
                      old home, and wanted to know if it was still there.&quot;</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">On Cohen's next
                        visit, he not only found Ramirez's home, he took pictures
                        and went inside. It had been turned into a private restaurant.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">When Cohen returned
                        to America, he contacted Ramirez and set up a meeting. &quot;I
                        played Cuban music in the background, gave him a Cuban
                        cigar, and showed him a picture of his home,&quot; Cohen
                        smiles.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Ramirez was
                        overcome with emotion for Cohen's gesture. &quot;It brought
                        him closure,&quot; 
                      Cohen muses. &quot;He had been holding all these emotions
                      inside because it had been a horrible experience for him,
                      to leave in the middle of the night, not knowing when he
                      would see his parents again.&quot;</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">&quot;It was
                        so little, but I got so much out of it,&quot; Cohen smiles.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Little things
                        mean a lot for Cuban Jewry. A local benefactor, John
                        Wolf Jr., recently sent down art supplies for a talented
                        Cuban Jewish artist, Jose Farinas. Those canvases and
                        oils were put to immediate use, with the results to be
                        viewed back here in Pittsburgh: Farinas' artwork will
                        be featured during a Cuban Exposition, scheduled for
                        this spring at the Jewish Community Center in Squirrel
                        Hill.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">&quot;We have
                        been collecting artwork and artifacts that will benefit
                        the Cuban Jewish community,&quot; Cohen notes, adding
                        that supplies are always needed.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">From the Judaica
                        contributed by Pinsker's to the vitamins from Brother's
                        Brother, to money and powdered milk, the Jewish community
                        has answered Cohen's call for aid.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1">&quot;We still
                        need to do this,&quot; Cohen insists. &quot;Things seem
                        to be a little bit better, but it will be a long time
                        until things begin to trickle-down to the people. Everything
                        we do really helps these people.&quot;</font></p>
