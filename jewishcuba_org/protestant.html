              <h2><b>Cuba's other Christians: Island's Protestant population climbing 
                </b></h2>
              <p><b> By Ira Rifkin<br>
                &copy; 1998 Religion News Service </b>
              <p><b> Lois Kroehler can remember what it was like for Protestants 
                in Cuba in the late 1950s: Roman Catholics would cross the street 
                rather than walk past the Presbyterian-affiliated school she ran 
                in Cardenas, about 90 miles east of Havana. </b>
              <p><b> "The local Catholic priest taught that Protestants were the 
                devil and that the people should not send their children to our 
                school," said Kroehler, an American who has spent more than 40 
                years in Cuba as a Presbyterian missionary.<br>
                <br>
                Protestants were a distinct minority in overwhelmingly Catholic, 
                pre-Castro Cuba when Kroehler, fresh out of the University of 
                Nebraska, followed her religious inclinations and moved to the 
                Caribbean island nation, where she has lived ever since.<br>
                <br>
                It's a different story today.<br>
                <br>
                The Cuba Pope John Paul II will visit for five days beginning 
                Wednesday (Jan. 21) is now the Western Hemisphere's only Spanish-speaking 
                nation in which the number of practicing Protestants comes close 
                to equaling the number of practicing Catholics.<br>
                <br>
                Moreover, Cuba's Protestant churches are growing at a faster rate 
                than the island's Catholic Church, which suffers from an acute 
                shortage of priests and bore the brunt of Fidel Castro's past 
                anti-religion policies.<br>
                <br>
                "We're not talking about Mexico or Peru here," said Mario Antonio 
                Ramos, a Cuban-born Southern Baptist pastor who now lives in Miami. 
                "Cuba has lots of American influences and a tradition of religious 
                diversity that has proved fertile for Protestant evangelism."<br>
                <br>
                Like its Latin American neighbors, Cuba has a long history of 
                Catholic religious association, dating from the 16th-century arrival 
                of Spanish colonizers. And despite almost four decades of Cuban 
                Marxism and, at times, severe persecution, the Cuban Catholic 
                Church remains the nation's largest single entity not under government 
                control.<br>
                <br>
                But institutional breadth aside, the Catholic Church's religious 
                hold over Cubans is limited. While about 40 percent of Cuba's 
                11 million people are baptized Catholics, only about 400,000 attend 
                services at the island's 650 Catholic churches and 200 "casas 
                de mision," or prayer houses.<br>
                <br>
                Moreover, many of those baptized as Catholics are closer to the 
                Afro-Cuban folk religion Santeria than they are the church.<br>
                <br>
                "For many Santeria followers, Catholic baptism is a requirement. 
                But that doesn't really make them Catholic," said Andres Perez 
                y Mena, an expert on Afro-Cuban religion who teaches at Long Island 
                University in Brooklyn, N.Y.<br>
                <br>
                Santeria -- "the way of the saints" in Spanish -- combines the 
                worship of traditional African dieties with the adoration of Catholic 
                saints. The deities were given saint's names by Cuba's slave population 
                to fool their Spanish colonial masters who imposed Catholic conversion 
                on them.<br>
                <br>
                As many as 3 million Cubans are involved in Santeria, according 
                to some estimates. Santeria, which is home-centered and has no 
                institutional structure, involves ritual animal sacrifice -- usually 
                using chickens or goats -- and physical and psychological healing 
                ceremonies.<br>
                <br>
                Meanwhile, more than 300,000 Cubans belong to the nation's 54 
                Protestant denominations, who operate some 1,666 churches and 
                hundreds of home-based congregations, said the Rev. Pablo Oden 
                Marichal, an Episcopal priest and national coordinator of the 
                Cuban Council of Churches. More than 700 of the churches have 
                been established since 1992, when the Cuban government jettisoned 
                its official "atheist" status and relabeled the nation "secular."<br>
                <br>
                "The evangelical churches (as Protestant churches are generally 
                referred to in Cuba and elsewhere in Latin America) are growing 
                very rapidly, much faster than the Catholic Church," Marichal 
                said.<br>
                <br>
                "While the Catholics are concentrated in the cities, evangelical 
                churches are everywhere in Cuba. Even in remote mountain areas. 
                So people looking for religion see us where they do not see Catholic 
                priests or churches."<br>
                <br>
                Cuba's Protestant churches also command a higher degree of theological 
                loyalty than does the Cuban Catholic Church. The influence on 
                them of Santeria and other Afro-Cuban religious beliefs is much 
                less obvious.<br>
                <br>
                "The Protestants in Cuba are very Protestant, just like they are 
                in Georgia or Alabama," said Ramos, who is also acting dean of 
                Miami's South Florida Center for Theological Studies.<br>
                <br>
                Protestantism arrived in Cuba during the mid-18th century, brought 
                there by American missionaries and later by returning Cuban political 
                exiles who plotted the end of Spanish rule from safehavens in 
                the United States.<br>
                <br>
                Today, Cuba's Protestant leadership is largely homegrown, with 
                virtually all pastors being Cuban. That's in contrast to the Cuban 
                Catholic Church, more than half of whose about 290 priests are 
                foreign born.<br>
                <br>
                Cuba's Protestant leaders -- under the aegis of the Cuban Council 
                of Churches -- will meet with the pope during his upcoming visit. 
                The session is scheduled for the morning of Jan. 25, just prior 
                to what promises to be the best-attended Mass of the papal visit. 
                That Mass is set for Havana's Revolution Square on the pope's 
                last day in Cuba.<br>
                <br>
                Baptists -- about 70,000 strong -- constitute the largest Protestant 
                grouping in Cuba. Seventh-day Adventists, Methodists, Presbyterians 
                and Episcopalians are among the larger Protestant groups.<br>
                <br>
                Pentecostal groups, such as the Assemblies of God, and charismatic 
                movements within the mainline denominations are a mainstay of 
                Cuban Protestantism today.<br>
                <br>
                "Cuban culture is Caribbean," said Harvard Divinity School professor 
                Harvey Cox. "It's emotional and has a strong African component 
                imported by the slaves. Pentecostal faith is experiential, communitarian, 
                healing and body-involving. It fits right in with the Caribbean 
                character."<br>
                <br>
                Both Catholic and Protestant leaders in Cuba talk today of the 
                nation's new interest in religion as an alternative to Cuba's 
                faltering Marxist ideology and the despair over the poverty gripping 
                the island.<br>
                <br>
                But observers of the Cuban religious scene say the ranks of the 
                nation's Protestant churches also have grown since the 1959 revolution 
                that established Castro's rule simply because, like the revolution, 
                they, too, presented an alternative to a discredited Catholic 
                Church.<br>
                <br>
                While the Protestant churches were also persecuted during the 
                early years of Castro's rule, they faced fewer adversities than 
                did the Catholic Church, which was heavily identified with the 
                deposed government of Fulgencio Batista and actively opposed Castro's 
                attempts to nationalize the private sector.<br>
                <br>
                "The church set itself up against the government out of fear of 
                communism," said Anthony Stevens-Arroyo, president of the Program 
                for the Analysis of Religion Among Latinos (PARAL) at the City 
                University of New York. "It overestimated its power and paid a 
                price."<br>
                <br>
                Much of the Catholic Church's base of support -- upper- and middle-class 
                white Cubans -- were among the first Cubans to flee the island 
                for the United States and elsewhere.<br>
                <br>
                Protestants, on the other hand, "were more sympathetic with the 
                revolution because they were never in power," explained the Rev. 
                Oscar Boliolo, Latin America and Caribbean director for the New 
                York-based National Council of Churches.<br>
                <br>
                "With the revolution, Protestants felt they gained a voice in 
                Cuban society, as limited as it may be."<br>
                <br>
                Perez y Mena said Cuban Protestants remain closer to the Castro 
                government than practicing Catholics and more likely to "participate 
                in the search for Christian-based socialism" in Cuba.<br>
                <br>
                "Their activism is what's keeping some social projects alive," 
                he said.<br>
                <br>
                The government has rewarded the Protestant churches by allowing 
                the Cuban Council of Churches to broadcast on state radio at Christmas 
                and Easter. Catholics have been denied that privilege, although 
                Havana Cardinal Jaime Ortega was allowed to make an unprecedented 
                appearance Tuesday (Jan 13) on state television, a concession 
                made as part of the papal visit.<br>
