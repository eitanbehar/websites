              <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sometime in the sixties, 
                after the first big wave of Cuban immigrants had settled whole 
                neighborhoods in Miami, my family traveled there from our home 
                in Tampa to visit old friends. One of the Cuban families we know 
                was Jewish; they had owned a jewelery store in a street that was 
                Havana's equivalent of New York's diamond district. Unlike the 
                other Cuban exiles we knew, however, this family lived not in 
                Miami but in Miami Beach, in the low-rent zone that has since 
                become trendy South Beach but until the mid-eighties was populated 
                by Jewish retirees from the Northeast. I suppose it was their 
                Jewishness that made them choose (Jewish) Miami Beach rather than 
                (gentile) Miami. However, when we, uncertain of the address, began 
                to inquire about them in the neighborhood, one of the old ladies 
                sunning themselves outside told us, in a thick New York accent, 
                "Oh, yes, the Cuban family." </font> 
              <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jewish in Miami, Cuban 
                in Miami Beach, our friends were not the only Cuban Jews who would 
                make their home in South Florida. Today the Miami Cuban Jews, 
                the <font color="#000055">"Jewbans"</font> in local slang, are 
                a majority in some areas of Miami Beach, just as gentile Cubans 
                are a majority in many Miami neighborhoods. Quite a few Jewbans 
                are prosperous, as are many of the gentile Cubans across the water. 
                They form a tightly knit community, and this provokes the comment 
                that is applied not only to Jews of all nationalities but also 
                to Cubans of all religious or racial background: they are clannish. 
                Cubans, most Latinos will tell you when they do not have to be 
                politically correct, are "the Jews of the Caribbean." </font> 
              <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What is meant by this 
                is a mixture of admiration and loathing. Cuban Americans are the 
                most prosperous and successful Latino group in America. The neighborhoods 
                they inhabit in Miami include some of the priciest real estate 
                in town. The mayor of the City of Miami is a Cuban American, as 
                is the mayor of Dade County. Two Cuban Americans represent the 
                city in the U.S. House of Representatives. The presidents of Florida 
                International University and Miami-Dade Community College -- both 
                of them vast, multi-campus complexes -- are Cuban Americans. Miami 
                bank presidents, real estate moguls, newspaper publishers, and, 
                yes, doctors and lawyers are Cuban. </font> 
              <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The U. S. government 
                did deploy a massive assistance program to benefit Cuban exiles 
                who were fleeing a Communist country during the peak of the cold 
                war. But the Cuban-American success story is also the result of 
                a tough work ethic that, contrary to the status consciousness 
                embodied in the aristocratic Spanish tradition of <i> hidalguia</i>, 
                pushed members of Cuba's dispossessed professional classes to 
                take the most menial jobs, study at night to recover their professional 
                standing, and save money. This is the <i> admirable part</i> of 
                the Jews-of-the-Caribbean reputation, which is quite parallel 
                to the rise of Jewish Americans from impoverished immigrants to 
                affluent and influential members of society. </font> 
              <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The<i> loathing</i> 
                comes in part from envy. Some view the reception Cuban exiles 
                received from the U.S. government as a form of special treatment. 
                They believe (perhaps fairly) that the Cubans were accorded this 
                welcome, among other reasons, because they -- unlike other Caribbean 
                immigrants -- were mostly white. But primarily the loathing comes 
                from the perception that Cubans are, as I said, clannish. </font> 
              <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is some truth 
                in this, as there is when the term is applied to Jews. Beleagured, 
                a people turn toward one another for help. And, in spite of the 
                welcome mat spread by Uncle Sam, Cuban exiles felt beleagured; 
                after all, they had just lost everything. Also, Miami in the early 
                sixties, although far more tolerant than most of the American 
                South at the time, was still the South. White Cubans, for the 
                first time in their lives, had to confront people who did not 
                think they were white, or at least white enough. Anti-Cuban discrimination 
                was mild compared to what was experienced by other Latino groups 
                in places like, say, Texas, where Mexican-American children were 
                summarily beaten for speaking Spanish in school. But there was 
                discrimination, and this prompted many Cuban exiles to distrust 
                anyone other than their own. </font>
