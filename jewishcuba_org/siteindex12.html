                  we are now getting reports of persons who have traveled to Cuba

                  Travel to Cuba by United States citizens is either illegal or 
                  not illegal, depending on how you get there. It is illegal for 
                  a United States citizen to spend money in Cuba unless he or 
                  she goes with an approved group such as the <a href="http://thecajm.org" target="_blank"><b>Cuba-America

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">You can 
                  cash <b>American Express</b> travelers' checks at the Hotel 
                  Nacional in Havana if you have your passport and the receipt 
                  of your check purchase. Two or three other hotels will also 
                  cash these checks, which is a departure from the usual practice 
                  of not honoring anything from a United States bank.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Detailed information on Cuba 
                  can be found in Chris Baker's comprehensive guide, <a href="cbaker.html"> 
                  <b>Moon Handbooks: Cuba</b></a>. We recommend this book for 
                  anyone going to Cuba.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">The question is often asked, "Do 
                  the Cubans stamp my <b>U.S. passport</b>? The answer is "yes 
                  and no." Many people have reported no stamps at all. Some have 
                  had their passorts stamped with a musical note, on the back 
                  pages. This is possibly for internal Cuban control. Legal US 
                  travelers receive an entry and exit visa as separate pieces 
                  of paper.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Cuba has a good system of <b>buses</b> 
                  for city-to-city travel. They are comfortable, generally operate 
                  on time, and are not too expensive by tourist standards. For 
                  example, Trinidad to Havana was $25 in early 2004. Trains are 
                  also an option but are usually slower than buses. Around each 
                  bus station you can also find individuals available to give 
                  you a ride at roughly the same price a bus would charge. Be 
                  careful using this option since many of these rides are illegally 
                  operated. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> One other option for the fit 
                  and adventurous is<b> biking </b>through Cuba. You will not 
                  be alone, since bikes are a major form of transportation. Check 
                  out Marcia Miquelon's story on&#160; <a href="http://danenet.wicip.org/bcp/bfw/forever.html" target="_blank"><b>http://danenet.wicip.org/bcp/bfw/forever.html</b></a>

                </p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Eventually Cuba will be a major 
                  tourist destination for United States citizens, but in the meantime 
                  the legality of travel there is still clouded, and the most 
                  direct route to get there may take many turns.</font></p>
