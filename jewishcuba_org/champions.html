              <h1>A Report from Inside Cuba</h1>
              <p> <b> Church thrives despite hardship and persecution<br>
                By Franco Gennaro<br>
                Champions for Christ - Latin America </b> 
              <p> HAVANA (FRI) - As I stare out the window of my shabby 12th-floor 
                hotel room overlooking the city of Havana, Cuba, I think through 
                this past trip which has been both exciting and sobering. I have 
                had the privilege of not only ministering in various unregistered 
                (non-government) churches, but also encouraging pastors in private 
                meetings. 
              <p> These men and women are the heroes of today. They have faced 
                persecution, poverty, sacrifice and terror and are still living 
                through it. These brothers and sisters often go without food due 
                to the economic crisis. This is especially sad when I realize 
                that they live just 90 miles from the United States. 
              <p> In spite of these incredible hardships, there has been an explosion 
                of revival and an incredible outpouring of the Holy Spirit on 
                this island. Most church buildings are jam-packed, with standing-room-only 
                crowds. While in the 1960s and 1970s many church buildings were 
                closed down, today lines of people go out the front doors of churches 
                - even into the streets. Recently, many congregations have doubled, 
                and even tripled, in attendance. 
              <p> Even more exciting is that fact that 70 percent of church membership 
                is under 30 years of age. There is a spiritual hunger among youth 
                in Cuba like never before. However, because of this growth, the 
                government is now beginning to crack down on the local churches, 
                as it perceives Christianity to be a threat to its future existence. 
              <p> On my first trip to Cuba in 1993, there was more of an openness 
                to Christianity in the government. Now, there is growing suspicion, 
                fear and worry that this Christian revolution is getting out of 
                hand. Restrictions and harassment toward ministers have become 
                commonplace, with some churches being closed by the government. 
                Though a good international public relations image has been recently 
                created by the country's leadership, behind the scenes there is 
                great concern that allegiance to communism is faltering. 
              <p>Another method being waged against the phenomenal church growth 
                is the promotion of a substitutionary religion in Cuba - Witchcraft. 
                The government now openly states that Brujera/Santeria is the 
                &quot;official cultural religion&quot; of the island. In any government 
                store you can find entire sections devoted to the sale of artifacts, 
                dress and instruments for the practice of this demonic spiritual 
                substitute. Moreover, Cuba has sponsored international conferences 
                and workshops on the introduction of Santeria. 
              <p> Missionary Hudson Taylor said, &quot;The Great Commission is 
                not an option to be considered, it is a command to be obeyed!&quot; 
                The trumpet sound is clear. In addition to sending Champions for 
                Christ evangelism teams to Costa Rica, Honduras, Panama, Colombia, 
                Peru and Nicaragua, we will proceed this year with an outreach 
                to Cuba.
