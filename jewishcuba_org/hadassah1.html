        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Call it the pearl 
          of the Antilles, the Casablanca of the Caribbean, a tropical paradise. 
          Describe it as exhilarating, lined with seductive beaches melting into 
          a magnificent coastline ringed with deep bays. Add grasslands, gentle 
          slopes, rolling hills, towering mountains and people who are warm and 
          welcoming. This is Cuba. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Travelers to this 
          island 90 miles south of Key West, Florida, discover an impoverished 
          country of about 12 million, living in an area 780 miles long and 119 
          miles wide. But somehow the morning sun and the hot, salty breezes push 
          the privation into the background. And the capital, Havana, still stands 
          as one of the most beautiful cities in the world despite its seedy appearance. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>History</b><a name=History></a><br>
          There were Marranos—forced Jewish converts—among the first European 
          settlers on the island in 1492. One of them, Luis de Torres, was sent 
          by Christopher Columbus on exploratory expeditions for gold. He did 
          not find gold, but he did discover something that would add to the riches 
          of Spanish coffers: Tobacco. Columbus himself fell in love with Cuba, 
          describing it as “the most beautiful island that human eyes have ever 
          seen.”</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Groups of Jews 
          fleeing Brazil during the Portuguese reconquest in the 17th century 
          settled in Cuba and promoted a flourishing trade with the Antilles and 
          nearby islands. In the 18th century Jewish merchants extended this trade 
          to Hamburg, Amsterdam and New York. Several were severely persecuted 
          by the Inquisition during these centuries and their possessions confiscated; 
          eventually most assimilated.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Colonized by Spain, 
          this largest island in the West Indies was used as a refueling port. 
          Because it had the greatest amount of arable land of any Caribbean island, 
          it absorbed a variety of people, including slaves (slavery was not abolished 
          until 1886).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">By the end of the 
          19th century, Cubans sought to overthrow their Spanish rulers. The patriot 
          José Marti (1853-1895)—poet, essayist, children’s book writer and revolutionary—fought 
          for autonomy. Jews in New York aided Marti’s cause, as did those in 
          nearby Curaçao. Jamaica’s Jewish De Cordova family also supported the 
          struggle.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The contemporary 
          community does not represent a line of continuity with the Jews of the 
          18th century. Its origins were linked to the War of Independence from 
          Spain in 1868 and the Spanish-American War of 1898, which saw Jews among 
          the troops invading the island. American Jews began to settle at the 
          end of the 19th century as veteran soldiers or as businessmen. They 
          engaged mostly in import and export, as well as in sugar and tobacco 
          farming. In 1904, they founded the Union Hebrew Congregation with a 
          Reform synagogue, and in 1906 acquired a cemetery. In the early 20th 
          century, Sefardim from Turkey and North Africa arrived.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Ashkenazim came 
          after World War I, using Cuba as a transit stop to the United States. 
          However, after Washington’s imposition of quotas in 1924, many stayed 
          on the island, becoming small-shop owners, manufacturers, tailors, shoemakers 
          and peddlers. By 1924, 24,000 Jews lived in Cuba. Over the next few 
          decades many had difficulty adjusting and they left. </font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1933, Fulgencio 
          Batista took over the cuban government. For the next 25 years he ruled 
          with an iron fist, establishing lasting relationships with organized 
          crime. Havana became known as a playground for wealthy gamblers; Meyer 
          Lansky and other prominent American gangsters were heavily invested 
          in the city. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">During World War 
          II, Jewish refugees from Antwerp introduced the diamond-polishing industry 
          and by 1944 established 24 plants employing 1,000 workers. In 1952 the 
          Jewish population of the island was estimated at about 12,000, with 
          75 percent concentrated in Havana.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Discontent under 
          Batista spawned the beginnings of Fidel Castro’s 26th of July movement 
          in 1953. The United States meanwhile supplied Batista with military 
          equipment but failed to win him victory over Castro’s guerrillas.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">“Fate played a 
          trick on the Jews who had made Cuba their home,” writes Robert M. Levine 
          in his book <em>Tropical Diaspora: The Jewish Experience in Cuba</em> 
          (University Press of Florida). “Even during the government’s anti-religious 
          campaign, Castro bent over backward not to persecute Jews.” However, 
          since they were in commerce they “fell into the category of enemies 
          of the revolution.” When Castro nationalized business and property and 
          introduced Communism, that was enough for Jewish entrepreneurs. Most 
          left for the United States, Mexico and Venezuela. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Cuban Jewry today 
          is a far cry from what it used to be. More than 90 percent left after 
          Castro and his revolutionaries marched into Havana on January 1, 1959. 
          In its heyday, there were five Jewish elementary schools, one Jewish 
          high school and five synagogues in the city.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With the departures, 
          synagogues closed down, living conditions deteriorated and Jewish schools 
          ceased functioning. Young Jews did not want to be associated with Judaism 
          or the synagogue since their careers would be compromised. When the 
          United States severed relations in 1961, the remnants clung to Judaism 
          as best they could. They only knew who was a Jew during those decades 
          when at Passover people came to claim matza sent by the Canadian Jewish 
          Congress. No aid came from the United States until 1991.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Moreover, in 1973 
          Israel and Cuba severed relations and Cuba supplied troops to Syria 
          during the Yom Kippur War.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Still, the Jewish 
          community was saved by two cataclysmic events in the 1990’s. The Soviet 
          Union not only collapsed and withdrew its economic and financial support; 
          Castro had to lift restrictions and welcome hard currency to fill the 
          deficit. And in 1998, Pope John Paul II’s visit led to religious institutions 
          functioning openly. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With the new opportunity, 
          Jewish organizations and foundations, headed by the American Jewish 
          Joint Distribution Committee, arrived to help. Buildings were repaired, 
          prayer books brought in, Jewish instructors hired, a school opened. 
          Rabbis began to visit, tourists came with needed medicine, clothes and 
          Jewish books. After having lost one or two generations, the community 
          revived. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Community</b><a name=Community></a><br>
          Today there is a reborn Havana Jewish community of approximately 1,500, 
          including several hundred in the provinces. Synagogues and community 
          centers have been rebuilt and refurbished.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">More than 90 percent 
          of the Jews today are intermarried and Jewish knowledge is limited. 
          Many work in the professions as doctors and engineers (though the average 
          monthly income of a physician is $10 to $25). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Most of the money 
          to support the synagogues, purchase kosher meat, run the school—including 
          transportation by bus from all over Havana—to provide welfare funds, 
          pay for medicines and cover the costs for Shabbat meals comes from the 
          JDC, which receives its funds from the United Jewish Communities. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Religious and humanitarian 
          missions bring in needed medicine and supplies. The economy is bolstered 
          by Cuban Americans, including Jews who fled and have been sending thousands 
          of dollars.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The hope of the 
          community is the religious school, which meets once a week in El Patronato 
          Synagogue. In 1991 the school had 10 students and three teachers with 
          no Jewish training; today 90 students start their days singing “<em>Hatikva</em>.” 
          Since 1991 about 600 Jews have emigrated to Israel.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">There is no permanent 
          rabbi on the island. Rabbi Shmuel Szteinhendler of Santiago, Chile, 
          is considered the chief rabbi and visits several times a year. Two young 
          Argentines, Mariano Merelman and Yael Fleischman, serve the community. 
          Merelman conducts services and Fleischman heads the school, Majón Tikún 
          Olam. Together they coordinate activities, act as organizers, teachers, 
          advisers and at times even spiritual leaders. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Beth Shalom/El 
          Patronato Synagogue and Community Center, Calle 1, stands between 13th 
          and 15th Streets in the Vedado section (bethshalom@enet.cu). Services 
          are held on Friday nights at 7 o’clock and Saturday mornings at 10 in 
          this refurbished 50-year-old Conservative synagogue. After services 
          there is a Kiddush and modest Shabbat dinner. It is not unusual for 
          women to pack up the bones and take them home for a soup. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">B’nai B’rith and 
          Hadassah meet in Beth Shalom. Fifty members of the Hadassah chapter—most 
          of them health care professionals—gather monthly. A lecture and news 
          about Hadassah Hospital are presented, explains Dr. Rosa Behar, president 
          of Hadassah–Cuba (telephone: 011-537-328-953; telcu@ip.etecsa.cu). While 
          noting that the chapter does not fund raise, “We do a lot to prevent 
          disease,” she says, as well as “support the Sunday school with material 
          and contests relating to Purim and other holidays.” </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The Orthodox Adath 
          Israel (Calle Acosta and Pictota 52; 537-861-3495; adath@enet.cu) functions 
          in Old Havana. In 1990, its 120-person membership was mostly seniors. 
          Today, children attend services and there is a <em>mikve</em>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shabbat services 
          are held Friday nights and Saturday mornings in The Sephardic Hebrew 
          Center of Cuba (Calle 17, between E and F Streets in the Vedado section 
          near El Patronato; 537-832-6623; judiosefarado@yahoo.com). The nine 
          Torah scrolls came from the closed Hebrew Union Chevet Achim synagogue.

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Author Ernest Hemingway 
          spent much of his writing life here. There are conspicuous reminders 
          of the 22 years he romped around the island as if it were his playground. 
          At the popular El Floridita restaurant, he supposedly invented the daiquiri. 
          At the nearby Bodeguita del Medio, with fascinating caricatures on the 
          walls, the novelist drank mojitos: rum, lime juice, sugar and freshly 
          crushed mint leaves. He even searched for German submarines, made famous 
          in his book <em>Islands in the Stream</em>. To this day, Hemingway is 
          accused of anti-Semitism, notably apparent in <em>The Sun Also Rises</em>.

          In the summer of 2004, the United States ruled that Cuban Americans 
          could visit relatives only every three years. They can not send money 
          except to family members; those who receive support in American dollars 
          were told by Castro to have money sent in foreign currencies. The dollar

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 25-room Hotel 
          Raquel is Cuba’s first hotel catering specifically to Jewish tourists. 
          At San Ignacio and Amargura Streets, six blocks from the Adath Israel 
          synagogue, the building’s eclectic architecture and Art Nouveau interiors 
          have been refurbished. Rooms are named after biblical matriarchs and 
          patriarchs and Jewish touches seem to be everywhere.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Four ornate chandeliers 
          patterned after the Star of David hang in the lobby, while paintings 
          by contemporary Cuban Jewish artist José Farinas adorn the walls. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Right next to Lejaim, 
          the lobby bar, is the Bezalel boutique, which sells gifts and Judaica. 
          The Garden of Eden restaurant offers a variety of kosher-style items 
          but does not strictly follow the laws of <em>kashrut</em>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In addition to 
          American Jews, the Raquel clearly hopes to attract Israeli tourists. 
          Though Castro broke off relations with the Jewish state, tour operators 
          in Tel Aviv estimate that at least 10,000 Israelis have visited Cuba.
