                <p> <b>MICHAEL FOX</b></p>
                <p> <b></b><i>Bulletin Correspondent</i></p>
                <p> Although many American Jews are unaware of it, the waves of 
                  immigration that brought their ancestors to America early in 
                  this century sent thousands of Jews southward to Cuba. Some 
                  continued to the United States, but those who stayed created 
                  a Jewish community that thrived for decades.</p>
                <p> Now "<i>Havana Nagila</i>: The Jews of Cuba" recaptures that 
                  lost history. The exhaustively researched video documentary 
                  will make its world theatrical premiere at the Jewish Film Festival.</p>
                <p> "Havana Nagila" is a significant accomplishment, although 
                  occasionally its approach is more academic than entertaining. 
                  Producer Evan Garelle and writer-director Laura Paull, New York 
                  natives who now reside in Modesto, compress a remarkably wide 
                  range of subjects into a mere hour.</p>
                <p> The documentary shared first prize in the second annual Jewish 
                  Video Competition sponsored by the Judah L. Magnes Museum, and 
                  was shown with other winners last month at the Pacific Film 
                  Archive.</p>
                <p> Packed with factual information and first-person interviews, 
                  the video tells the story of the Jews who stayed in Cuba. Some 
                  stayed by choice, others because they were locked out of the 
                  United States in the 1920s and 1930s by State Department quotas.</p>
                <p> Historians, teachers and working people tell viewers that 
                  the Cuban people had no ingrained tradition of anti-Semitism. 
                  Jews were warmly welcomed into Cuban society.</p>
                <p> In the late '20s and early '30s, the Machado government persecuted 
                  Communists and Jews and promoted anti-Semitism. The Cuban people, 
                  however, didn't seem to embrace anti-Jewish sentiment with the 
                  same enthusiasm as residents of many other countries at the 
                  time.</p>
                <p> In fact, on a per-capita basis, Cuba accepted more Jewish 
                  refugees from Nazi Europe than several larger nations.</p>
                <p> After World War II, Jews gradually established themselves 
                  in all areas of Cuban life. The golden age for Jews in Cuba 
                  was Batista's second stint as president from 1952-59.</p>
                <p> The Jews who prospered under Batista had much to lose when 
                  Castro came to power and converted the economy to state-run 
                  socialism. According to one source quoted in "Havana Nagila," 
                  94 percent of Cuba's Jews left the country.</p>
                <p> Those who chose to remain, however, embraced Castro's leadership 
                  and share his philosophy of nation-building to this day.</p>
                <p> "The task of the Jew," one Castro supporter asserts, "is not 
                  only to figure out how to live well but to contribute to peace 
                  and justice wherever in the world he may live."</p>
                <p> Along those lines, "Havana Nagila" offers a fascinating reminder 
                  that the pragmatic idealism of Castro's socialism is not so 
                  different from the ideology that led to Israel's kibbutz system.</p>
                <p> In words that wouldn't have sounded out of place in the Galilee 
                  in 1951, one likable young Cuban explains, "I respect the opinions 
                  of the Orthodox Jews and those who believe in faith. But as 
                  long as there is important work to be done, you won't find me 
                  at the synagogue."</p>
                <p> "Havana Nagila" notes that Israel lent its agricultural expertise 
                  to Cuba in the early years of Castro's reign. That phase of 
                  cooperation ended in 1973, when Cuba broke off diplomatic relations.</p>
                <p> Geopolitics is at the heart of any discussion of Cuba, especially 
                  in light of the ongoing U.S. embargo of the island. One of the 
                  video's most fascinating passages charts the difficulty of getting 
                  Passover supplies for a seder. And those rituals and traditions, 
                  important to Jews everywhere, are perhaps even more important 
                  in Cuba's tiny 1,600-member Jewish community. </p>
